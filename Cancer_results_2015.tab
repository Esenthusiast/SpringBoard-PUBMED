29071011	2017	10	Cancer Chemopreventive Potential of Procyanidin.	"['Chemoprevention entails the use of synthetic agents or naturally occurring dietary phytochemicals to prevent cancer development and progression. One promising chemopreventive agent, procyanidin, is a naturally occurring polyphenol that exhibits beneficial health effects including anti-inflammatory, antiproliferative, and antitumor activities. Currently, many preclinical reports suggest procyanidin as a promising lead compound for cancer prevention and treatment. As a potential anticancer agent, procyanidin has been shown to inhibit the proliferation of various cancer cells in ""in vitro and in vivo"". Procyanidin has numerous targets, many of which are components of intracellular signaling pathways, including proinflammatory mediators, regulators of cell survival and apoptosis, and angiogenic and metastatic mediators, and modulates a set of upstream kinases, transcription factors, and their regulators. Although remarkable progress characterizing the molecular mechanisms and targets underlying the anticancer properties of procyanidin has been made in the past decade, the chemopreventive targets or biomarkers of procyanidin action have not been completely elucidated. This review focuses on the apoptosis and tumor inhibitory effects of procyanidin with respect to its bioavailability.']"	('Lee', 'Yongkyu')	Toxicological research	Toxicol Res	['eng']

"[""Inv(16)(p13q22) and t(16;16)(p13;q22) are cytogenetic hallmarks of acute myelomonoblastic leukaemia, most of them associated with abnormal bone marrow eosinophils [acute myeloid leukaemia French-American-British classification M4 with eosinophilia (FAB AML-M4Eo)] and a relatively favourable clinical course. They generate a 5'CBFB-3'MYH11 fusion gene. However, in a few cases, although RT-PCR identified a CBFB-MYH11 transcript, normal karyotype and/or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses using commercially available probes are found. We identified a 32-year-old woman with AML-M4Eo and normal karyotype and FISH results. Using two libraries of Bacterial Artificial Chromosome clones on 16p13 and 16q22, FISH analyses identified an insertion of 16q22 material in band 16p13, generating a CBFB-MYH11 type A transcript. Although very rare, insertions should be searched for in patients with discordant cytological and cytogenetic features because of the therapeutic consequences.

28690385	2017	11	The Use of Religious Coping Methods in a Secular Society: A Survey Study Among Cancer Patients in Sweden.	"[""In the present article, based on results from a survey study in Sweden among 2,355 cancer patients, the role of religion in coping is discussed. The survey study, in turn, was based on earlier findings from a qualitative study of cancer patients in Sweden. The purpose of the present survey study was to determine to what extent results obtained in the qualitative study can be applied to a wider population of cancer patients in Sweden. The present study shows that use of religious coping methods is infrequent among cancer patients in Sweden. Besides the two methods that are ranked in 12th and 13th place, that is, in the middle (Listening to religious music and Praying to God to make things better), the other religious coping methods receive the lowest rankings, showing how nonsignificant such methods are in coping with cancer in Sweden. However, the question of who turns to God and who is self-reliant in a critical situation is too complicated to be resolved solely in terms of the strength of individuals' religious commitments. In addition to background and situational factors, the culture in which the individual was socialized is an important factor. Regarding the influence of background variables, the present results show that gender, age, and area of upbringing played an important role in almost all of the religious coping methods our respondents used. In general, people in the oldest age-group, women, and people raised in places with 20,000 or fewer residents had a higher average use of religious coping methods than did younger people, men, and those raised in larger towns.""]"	('Ahmadi', 'Nader')	Illness, crises, and loss	Illn Crises Loss	['eng']

['Benzyl isothiocyanate (BITC) is one of member of the isothiocyanate family which has been shown to induce cancer cell apoptosis in many human cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the effects of BITC on the growth of GBM 8401 human brain glioblastoma multiforms cells. Results indicated that BITC-induced cell morphological changes decreased in the percentage of viable GBM8401 cells and these effects are dose-dependent manners. Results from flow cytometric assay indicated that BITC induced sub-G1 phase and induction of apoptosis of GBM 8401 cells. Furthermore, results also showed that BITC promoted the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ release, but decreased the mitochondrial membrane potential (??m ) and promoted caspase-8, -9, and -3 activates. After cells were pretreated with Z-IETD-FMK, Z-LEHD-FMK, and Z-DEVD-FMK (caspase-8, -9, and -3 inhibitors, respectively) led to decrease in the activities of caspase-8, -9, and -3 and increased the percentage of viable GBM 8401 cells that indicated which BITC induced cell apoptosis through caspase-dependent pathways. Western blotting indicated that BITC induced Fas, Fas-L, FADD, caspase-8, caspase -3, and pro-apoptotic protein (Bax, Bid, and Bak), but inhibited the ant-apoptotic proteins (Bcl-2 and Bcl-x) in GBM 8401 cells. Furthermore, BITC increased the release of cytochrome c, AIF, and Endo G from mitochondria that led to cell apoptosis. Results also showed that BITC increased GADD153, GRP 78, XBP-1, and ATF-6?, IRE-1?, IRE-1?, Calpain 1 and 2 in GBM 8401 cells, which is associated with ER stress. Based on these observations, we may suggest that BITC-induced apoptosis might be through Fas receptor, ROS induced ER stress, caspase-3, and mitochondrial signaling pathways. Taken together, these molecular alterations and signaling pathways offer an insight into BITC-caused growth inhibition and induced apoptotic cell death of GBM 8401 cells. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In earlier research it has been suggested that there is an influence of the expression of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (CD26) on both the homing and lymphocyte reconstitution after AHSCT. The aim of the study is to investigate the influence of transplanted cells CD26+ on the haematopoietic recovery and lymphocyte reconstitution after AHSCT in MM.

As measured by conization, HPV infection is associated with an increased risk of lymphoma. This association may be attributable to a chronic immune activation induced by persistent HPV infection and/or failure of the immune system both to clear HPV infection and to control lymphoma development.

Methods: 348 students of economics from the Leibniz University of Hanover were queried in July 2013 using an extensive questionnaire. Among other things, the participants were asked if they are interested in information about the probability to develop cancer in the future and their willingness to pay for such information. Data were analysed using descriptive statistics and ordinal probit regressions. Additionally marginal effects were calculated. Results: About 50% of the students were interested in predictive oncological genetic testing and were willing to pay for the test. Moreover, the participants who were willing to pay for the test partly attach high monetary values to the information that could so be obtained. The study shows that the interest of the students and their willingness to pay were primarily influenced by individual attitudes and perceptions.

About 15-20\xa0% patients present with local recurrence after chemoradiation. Radical surgical resection is the only treatment modality offering long term survival benefit in recurrent cervical cancer. The most common surgical option for these patients is pelvic exenteration. Radical hysterectomy may be done for patients with a small centrally located recurrence in the cervix with no infiltration of adjacent structures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the morbidity and survival outcome following radical hysterectomy and pelvic exenteration for recurrent cancer cervix. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of our patients who underwent surgery for cancer cervix recurrence from January 2010 to December 2014. The postoperative morbidity was considered early if it happened in the initial 30\xa0days of surgery and late if it occurred after 30\xa0days. All patients were followed up till February 2015. Survival analysis was done using Kaplan- Meir method. Between January 2010 and December 2014, 20 patients with recurrent cervical cancer underwent radical surgical resection. The median age of the study group was 43\xa0years (range 28-63\xa0years). Seventeen patients had squamous cell carcinoma and 3 had adenocarcinoma. 13 underwent pelvic exenteration and 7 patients underwent radical type 2 hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphnode dissection. In the exenteration group, 8 patients had anterior exenteration, 4 had total exenteration and one had posterior exenteration. Urinary diversion was done by ileal conduit in 8 patients, double barrel colostomy in two and wet colostomy in two patients. There were no immediate postoperative deaths. Operating time, blood transfusions needed and hospital stay was more in the exenteration group compared to radical hysterectomy patients. After pelvic exenteration post-operative complications were seen in 76.9\xa0% of which the most common was of the urinary tract including 3 patients with pyelonephritis, 5 had renal insufficiency and 2 patients developed urinary fistulae. Post-operative morbidity was lower in radical hysterectomy patients. There were two patients in the hysterectomy group who developed vault recurrence while none in the exenteration group had local recurrence. The median follow up time was 19\xa0months (range 9-53\xa0months).Three year overall survival for the entire cohort was 43\xa0%. Median survival time for the exenteration group was 28\xa0months which was significantly higher than 14\xa0months for the radical hysterectomy group. This study shows that radical surgical resection is feasible with good survival outcome and acceptable morbidity in recurrent cancer cervix patients. Radical hysterectomy can be done in selected patients but pelvic exenteration has better long-term survival but with the potential for both short- & long-term complications.']	('Rema', 'P')	Indian journal of surgical oncology	Indian J Surg Oncol	['eng']

['ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters ABCC1 (MRP1), ABCB1 (P-gp), and ABCG2 (BCRP) contribute to chemotherapy failure. The primary goals of this study were to characterize the efficacy and mechanism of the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID), sulindac sulfide, to reverse ABCC1 mediated resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs and to determine if sulindac sulfide can influence sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs independently of drug efflux. Cytotoxicity assays were performed to measure resistance of ABC-expressing cell lines to doxorubicin and other chemotherapeutic drugs. NSAIDs were tested for the ability to restore sensitivity to resistance selected tumor cell lines, as well as a large panel of standard tumor cell lines. Other experiments characterized the mechanism by which sulindac sulfide inhibits ABCC1 substrate and co-substrate (GSH) transport in isolated membrane vesicles and intact cells. Selective reversal of multi-drug resistance (MDR), decreased efflux of doxorubicin, and fluorescent substrates were demonstrated by sulindac sulfide and a related NSAID, indomethacin, in resistance selected and engineered cell lines expressing ABCC1, but not ABCB1 or ABCG2. Sulindac sulfide also inhibited transport of leukotriene C4 into membrane vesicles. Sulindac sulfide enhanced the sensitivity to doxorubicin in 24 of 47 tumor cell lines, including all melanoma lines tested (7-7). Sulindac sulfide also decreased intracellular GSH in ABCC1 expressing cells, while the glutathione synthesis inhibitor, BSO, selectively increased sensitivity to sulindac sulfide induced cytotoxicity. Sulindac sulfide potently and selectively reverses ABCC1-mediated MDR at clinically achievable concentrations. ABCC1 expressing tumors may be highly sensitive to the direct cytotoxicity of sulindac sulfide, and in combination with chemotherapeutic drugs that induce oxidative stress.']	('Whitt', 'Jason D')	Journal of biomedical research	J Biomed Res	['eng']

They pose serious hazards on all personal involved in handling these medications as well as on patients and their caregivers. We addressed the gaps in knowledge and safe handling of oral anticancer agents among pharmacists in institutional based cancer care. Materials and Methods: We used a 41 item questionnaire to explore three domains, pharmacists' knowledge, safe handling practice and confidence and self-improving strategies towards these agents among pharmacists in multicentre specialized cancer care. Results: Participants included 120 pharmacists dedicated to handle and dispense oral anticancer agents. About 20% of Pharmacists have adequate knowledge about oral anticancer agents. Less than 50% apply safe handling principles adequately. Only a quarter are confident in educating cancer patients and their caregivers about Oral Anti-Cancer Agents. Conclusions: Pharmacists' knowledge about Oral Anticancer agents needs to be improved. Safe handling and dispensing practice of these medications should be optimized.

Progress has been impeded, however, by the small-sample, high-dimensional nature of proteomic data. We propose the application of a Bayesian approach to address this issue in classification of proteomic profiles generated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Our approach relies on a previously proposed model of the LC-MS experiment, as well as on the theory of the optimal Bayesian classifier (OBC). Computation of the OBC requires the combination of a likelihood-free methodology called approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) as well as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Numerical experiments using synthetic LC-MS data based on an actual human proteome indicate that the proposed ABC-MCMC classification rule outperforms classical methods such as support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, and 3-nearest neighbor classification rules in the case when sample size is small or the number of selected proteins used to classify is large.']	('Banerjee', 'Upamanyu')	Cancer informatics	Cancer Inform	['eng']

['With the completion of the human genome project, it is feasible to investigate large-scale human protein interaction network (HPIN) with complex networks theory. Proteins are encoded by genes. Essential, viable, disease, conserved, housekeeping (HK) and tissue-enriched (TE) genes are functional genes, which are organized and functioned via interaction networks. Based on up-to-date data from various databases or literature, two large-scale HPINs and six subnetworks are constructed. We illustrate that the HPINs and most of the subnetworks are sparse, small-world, scale-free, disassortative and with hierarchical modularity. Among the six subnetworks, essential, disease and HK subnetworks are more densely connected than the others. Statistical analysis on the topological structures of the HPIN reveals that the lethal, the conserved, the HK and the TE genes are with hallmark graphical features. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicate that the essential genes can be distinguished from the viable ones with accuracy as high as almost 70%. Closeness, semi-local and eigenvector centralities can distinguish the HK genes from the TE ones with accuracy around 82%. Furthermore, the Venn diagram, cluster dendgrams and classifications of disease genes reveal that some classes of disease genes are with hallmark graphical features, especially for cancer genes, HK disease genes and TE disease genes. The findings facilitate the identification of some functional genes via topological structures. The investigations shed some light on the characteristics of the compete interactome, which have potential implications in networked medicine and biological network control.']	('Wang', 'Pei')	IEEE transactions on biomedical circuits and systems	IEEE Trans Biomed Circuits Syst	['eng']

A more personalized approach, therefore, is needed to better define men at higher risk of developing PCa, discriminate indolent from aggressive disease and improve risk stratification after treatment by predicting the likelihood of progression. This may improve clinical decision-making regarding management, improve selection for active surveillance protocols and minimize morbidity from treatment. Discovery of new biomarkers associated with prostate carcinogenesis present an opportunity to provide patients with novel genetic signatures to better understand their risk of developing PCa and help forecast their clinical course.

27980386	2015	12	Quantitative Proteomic Approach for MicroRNA Target Prediction Based on 18O/16O Labeling.	[StringElement('Among many large-scale proteomic quantification methods, 18O/16O labeling requires neither specific amino acid in peptides nor label incorporation through several cell cycles, as in metabolic labeling; it does not cause significant elution time shifts between heavy- and light-labeled peptides, and its dynamic range of quantification is larger than that of tandem mass spectrometry-based quantification methods. These properties offer 18O/16O labeling the maximum flexibility in application. However, 18O/16O labeling introduces large quantification variations due to varying labeling efficiency. There lacks a processing pipeline that warrants the reliable identification of differentially expressed proteins (DEPs). This motivates us to develop a quantitative proteomic approach based on 18O/16O labeling and apply it on Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) microRNA (miR) target prediction. KSHV is a human pathogenic ?-herpesvirus strongly associated with the development of B-cell proliferative disorders, including primary effusion lymphoma. Recent studies suggest that miRs have evolved a highly complex network of interactions with the cellular and viral transcriptomes, and relatively few KSHV miR targets have been characterized at the functional level. While the new miR target prediction method, photoactivatable ribonucleoside-enhanced cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (PAR-CLIP), allows the identification of thousands of miR targets, the link between miRs and their targets still cannot be determined.

['Colon cancer is currently the third most common cancer and second most fatal cancer in the United States, resulting in approximately 600,000 deaths annually. Though colorectal cancer death rates are decreasing by about 3% every year, disease outcomes could be substantially improved with more research into the drivers of colon carcinogenesis, the determinants of aggressiveness in colorectal cancer and the identification of biomarkers that could enable choice of more optimal treatments. Colon carcinogenesis is notably a slow process that can take decades. Known factors that contribute to the development of colon cancer are mutational, epigenetic and environmental, and risk factors include age, history of polyps and family history of colon cancer. Colorectal cancers exhibit heterogeneity in their features and are often characterized by the presence of chromosomal instability, microscopic satellite instability, or CpG island methylator phenotype. In this review, we propose that centrosome amplification may be a widespread occurrence in colorectal cancers and could potently influence tumor biology. Moreover, the quantitation of this cancer-specific anomaly could offer valuable prognostic information and pave the way for further customization of treatment based on the organellar profile of patients. Patient stratification models that take into account centrosomal status could thus potentially reduce adverse side effects and result in improved outcomes for colorectal cancer patients.']	('Mahathre', 'Monica M')	Journal of biomedical research	J Biomed Res	['eng']

"['The high mortality of solid tumors can be attributed to their invasive and metastatic potential that is based on their migration and proliferation. Importantly, growth factor receptor (GF) signaling pathways regulating proliferation and migration are often affected by oncogenic mutations and are important targets for antitumor therapy. We found positive correlation between migration and proliferation in melanoma and lung cancer cells using videomicroscopy, not supporting the ""go or grow"" hypothesis. Furthermore, the invasion into collagen I matrices from brain tumor spheroids was not impaired upon the inhibition of proliferation. Sensitivity of human melanoma cells towards EGF and FGF2 treatment but not against GF receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors was oncogenic BRAF or NRAS mutation status dependent. Prenylation inhibition failed to decrease clonogenic growth in BRAF mutant but PTEN wild-type melanoma lines but increased migration in BRAF-mutant cells. In certain mesothelioma cells, activin signaling showed a pro-tumorigenic effect suggesting activin as a valuable candidate for therapeutic interference. In summary, our findings demonstrate that proliferation is neither an obstacle nor a prerequisite for tumor cell invasion. Furthermore, the specific oncogenic mutations may differentially regulate migration and proliferation of tumor cells.

The objective of this paper, therefore, was to explore the variation in the determinants of household enrolment and the impact of enrolment on health care utilization and medical expenditures in three large geographic regions in China. A quasi-experiment study was designed based on the panel data of the China Health and Nutrition Survey. The bounding approach was used to conduct a robust check of impact estimation under the assumption of unobserved bias. A major finding is that household income plays no significant role for enrolment, which indicates the equity of program coverage in income terms. However, regional circumstances matter. In the generally poorer western regions, households with a high ratio of migrant workers are less attracted to the NCMS program, and adoption of the program is related to the regional infrastructure environment variables in the eastern and western regions. The NCMS has improved medical care utilization for poor income groups and regions (western regions).

27870262	2016	11	The role of base excision repair in pathogenesis of breast cancer in the Polish population.	['Breast cancer (BC) is leading type of cancer among group of women, which determines almost 23% of invasive cancers. It has been reported repeatedly that the level of oxidative stress is higher for BC in comparison to cancer-free woman. The goal of the present study was to evaluate the role of base excision repair (BER) pathway in the development of BC. One-hundred seventy-one women with confirmed BC and 222 healthy controls were enrolled in presented study. The level of oxidative DNA damage and the kinetic of their repair were analyzed by the modified alkaline comet assay. The efficiency of BER pathway was evaluated by BER assay. The presence of the 326Cys/Cys genotype and 326Cys allele of OGG1 gene and the 324His/His of MUTYH gene are associated with increased risk of BC development. Moreover, correlation between clinical parameter with selected genes has shown increased risk of BC progression. The survival analysis has shown a significant lower DFS for individuals with the 762Ala/Ala genotype compared to 762Val/Vla carriers and the 762Val/Ala genotype in relation to concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy. In subgroup of patients with alone chemotherapy and alone radiotherapy, the 762Val/Val genotype was significantly associated with lower overall survival. Furthermore, we also elevated the level of basal and oxidative DNA damage in a group of patients with BC in relation to healthy controls. We also observed the difference in effectiveness of DNA damage repair. The results of present studies suggested the important role of BER pathway in BC development. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']	('Cuchra', 'Magda')	Molecular carcinogenesis	Mol. Carcinog.	['eng']
27867838	2015	01	Advances in miRNA-Mediated Mucin Regulation.	['MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are an important class of small non-coding RNAs that direct post-transcriptional gene regulation by different mechanisms. Mounting evidences from numerous studies in the last decade have unraveled that deregulated miRNAs, and their cognate target expressions are strongly implicated in the carcinogenesis. Recent advances have highlighted miRNA-mediated regulation of mucins that have critical role in inflammation and cancer biology. The aberrant expression and differential glycosylation of mucins cause tumorigenesis, metastasis, chemoresistance and poor outcome of cancer patients, thus recognizing them as attractive therapeutic targets. Though current mucin-based therapies (antibodies, vaccines, immunotherapy, peptide inhibitors) have shown preclinical utility but only a handful promise for clinical transferability. In this context, understanding miRNA-mediated modulation of multiple mucin(s) expression and function gives a new hope for future anti-tumor therapeutics. Herein, we reviewed miRNA biogenesis, mechanism of action, and their role in tumor development. Further, we provide an overview of miRNA-mediated mucin regulation and their application as anticancer therapeutics.']	('Krishn', 'Shiv Ram')	Current pharmacology reports	Curr Pharmacol Rep	['eng']

['Metabolomic studies have identified several metabolites associated with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in populations of European ancestry. East Asians, a population of particular susceptibility to T2D, were generally not included in previous studies. We examined the associations of plasma metabolites with risk and prevalence of T2D in 976 Chinese men and women (40-74 years of age) who were participants of two prospective cohort studies and had no cardiovascular disease or cancer at baseline. Sixty-eight prevalent and 73 incident T2D cases were included. Non-targeted metabolomics was conducted that detected 689 metabolites with known identities and 690 unknown metabolites. Multivariable logistic and Cox regressions were used to evaluate the associations of standardized metabolites with diabetes risk and prevalence. We identified 36 known metabolites and 10 unknown metabolites associated with prevalent and/or incident T2D at false discovery rate <0.05. The known metabolites are involved in metabolic pathways of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, branched-chain amino acids, other amino acids, fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, androgen, and bradykinin. Six metabolites showed independent associations with incident T2D: 1,5-anhydroglucitol, mannose, valine, 3-methoxytyrosine, docosapentaenoate (22:5n3), and bradykinin-hydroxy-pro(3). Each standard deviation increase in these metabolites was associated with a 40-150 % change in risk of developing diabetes (30-80 % after further adjustment for glucose). Risk prediction was significantly improved by adding these metabolites in addition to known T2D risk factors, including central obesity and glucose. These findings suggest that hexoses, branched-chain amino acids, and yet to be validated novel plasma metabolites may improve risk prediction and mechanistic understanding of T2D in Chinese populations.']	('Yu', 'Danxia')	Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society	Metabolomics	['eng']

27829829	2016	11	The pretransplant systemic metabolic profile reflects a risk of acute graft versus host disease after allogeneic stem cell transplantation.	['Allogeneic stem cell transplantation is used in the treatment of younger patients with severe hematological diseases, especially hematological malignancies, and acute graft versus host disease (GVHD) is then an important immune-mediated posttransplant complication. Several risk factors for acute GVHD have been identified, including pretransplant factors that possibly influence the posttranspant course through their effects on host immunocompetent cells. Metabolic regulation is important for immunoregulation, and we therefore investigated whether the pretransplant metabolic status of allotransplant recipients was associated with later acute GVHD. In our population-based study we investigated the systemic (serum) metabolic profile for 86 consecutive allotransplant recipients. The samples were collected before start of the pretransplant conditioning therapy. Patients who developed later acute GVHD especially showed altered pretransplant amino acid metabolism, including (1) altered metabolism of immunoregulatory branched chain amino acids (leucine, isoleucine and valine); and (2) altered levels of potentially proinflammatory tyrosine metabolites (p-cresol sulphate, 3-phenylpropionate) formed by the gastrointestinal microbial flora. However, isobutyrylcarnitine and propyonylcarnitine levels were also altered; the carnitines are important for the transport of fatty acids and may also be important for the release of immunoregulatory cytokines in allotransplant recipients. These metabolic alterations were associated with an ongoing pretransplant acute phase reaction or early hematopoietic/immune reconstitution. Thus, allotransplant recipients developing acute GVHD showed altered preconditioning/pretransplant levels of several immunoregulatory metabolites. Our hypothesis is that these metabolites alter or activate recipient immunocompetent cells and thereby enhance or initiate anti-recipient immune reactivity.']	('Reikvam', 'Håkon')	Metabolomics : Official journal of the Metabolomic Society	Metabolomics	['eng']

Methods: A cross-sectional survey using a specially designed questionnaire was conducted on a stratified random sample of the general population in the five geographical regions of Saudi Arabia (central, eastern, northern, southern, and western). Data were collected between October 2010 and March 2011. Multiple logistic regressions were applied to relate the use of sunscreen and skin cancer awareness with various socio-demographic variables. Results: The questionnaire was distributed to 2900 Saudis. A total of 2622 questionnaires were completed, returned, and included in the data analysis, corresponding to a response rate of 90.4%. The mean (SD) age of respondents was 27.8\xa0±\xa09.7\xa0years. Fifty percent (1301/1601) of the respondents were males.

['The presence of anti-p53 antibody in serum is a biomarker for cancer. However, its high sensitivity detection is still an issue in cancer diagnosis. To tackle this challenge, we used fd phage, a human-safe bacteria-specific virus nanofiber that can be mass-produced by infecting host bacteria in an error-free manner, and genetically engineered it to display a peptide capable of recognizing and capturing anti-p53 antibody on its side wall. We employed the resultant phage nanofibers as a capture probe to develop a modified version of the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) method, termed phage-ELISA. We compared it to the traditional ELISA method for the detection of anti-p53 antibody, p53-ELISA, which uses recombinant wild-type p53 protein to capture anti-p53 antibody. We applied phage-ELISA to detect anti-p53 antibody in an experimental group of 316 patients with various types of malignant tumors. We found that a detection rate of 17.7% (56 positive cases) was achieved by phage-ELISA, which was comparable to the detection rate of 20.6% for p53-ELISA (65 positive cases). However, when both phage and p53 were combined to form antibody-capturing probes for phage/p53-ELISA, a detection rate of 30.4% (96 positive cases) was achieved. Our work showed that owing to the combined capture of the anti-p53 antibody by both phage nanofibers and p53, the phage/p53-ELISA achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy and detection efficiency for the anti-p53 antibody in patients with various types of cancers. Our work suggests that a combination of nanofibers and antigens, both of which capture antibody, could lead to increased detection sensitivity, which is useful for applications in the life sciences, clinical medicine, and environmental sciences.']	('Pan', 'Pengtao')	Nano research	Nano Res	['eng']

Here, we review the representative environmental factors known to affect human intellectual development during each developmental stage. We describe what is (and what is not) being investigated to determine how these factors affect human brain development through analyses of volumetrical and cortical structures. In conclusion, environmental factors that affect children's intellectual development lead to three patterns of brain structural change. The first is global change in the brain structure, observed more often in the earlier phase of development. The second is structural changes concentrated in the medial prefrontal and adjacent areas and medial temporal areas, which are likely to be induced by stress in many cases. The third is sporadic region-specific change, likely to be primarily caused by use-dependent plasticity of the areas that is often observed in the later phase of development.

['Malnutrition is a common problem in oncological diseases, influencing treatment outcomes, treatment complications, quality of life and survival. The potential role of malnutrition has not yet been studied systematically in neuroendocrine neoplasms (NEN), which, due to their growing prevalence and additional therapeutic options, provide an increasing clinical challenge to diagnosis and management. The aim of this cross-sectional observational study, which included a long-term follow-up, was therefore to define the prevalence of malnutrition in 203 patients with NEN using various methodological approaches, and to analyse the short- and long-term outcome of malnourished patients. A detailed subgroup analysis was also performed to define risk factors for poorer outcome. When applying malnutrition screening scores, 21-25% of the NEN patients were at risk of or demonstrated manifest malnutrition. This was confirmed by anthropometric measurements, by determination of serum surrogate parameters such as albumin as well as by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA), particularly phase angle ?. The length of hospital stay was significantly longer in malnourished NEN patients, while long-term overall survival was highly significantly reduced. Patients with high-grade (G3) neuroendocrine carcinomas, progressive disease and undergoing chemotherapy were at particular risk of malnutrition associated with a poorer outcome. Multivariate analysis confirmed the important and highly significant role of malnutrition as an independent prognostic factor for NEN besides proliferative capacity (G3 NEC). Malnutrition is therefore an underrecognized problem in NEN patients which should systematically be diagnosed by widely available standard methods such as Nutritional Risk Screening (NRS), serum albumin assessment and BIA, and treated to improve both short- and long-term outcomes.']	('Maasberg', 'Sebastian')	Neuroendocrinology	Neuroendocrinology	['eng']

['Computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) is a promising tool for accurate and consistent diagnosis and prognosis. Cell detection and segmentation are essential steps for CAD. These tasks are challenging due to variations in cell shapes, touching cells, and cluttered background. In this paper, we present a cell detection and segmentation algorithm using the sparse reconstruction with trivial templates and a stacked denoising autoencoder (sDAE). The sparse reconstruction handles the shape variations by representing a testing patch as a linear combination of shapes in the learned dictionary. Trivial templates are used to model the touching parts. The sDAE, trained with the original data and their structured labels, is used for cell segmentation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply sparse reconstruction and sDAE with structured labels for cell detection and segmentation. The proposed method is extensively tested on two data sets containing more than 3000 cells obtained from brain tumor and lung cancer images. Our algorithm achieves the best performance compared with other state of the arts.']	('Su', 'Hai')	Medical image computing and computer-assisted intervention : MICCAI ...

['Phospholipase C beta 1 (PLC?1) expresses in gliomas and cultured glial cells, but its expression is barely detectable in normal glial cells. We analyzed data from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO-GDSxxx), The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), and the Repository for Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) to explore the potential role of PLC?1 as a biomarker in high-grade glioma (HGG). PLC?1 expression is significantly higher in grade III gliomas than that in grade IV gliomas from GDS1815 (n\u2009=\u200924 vs. 76), GDS1962 (n\u2009=\u200919 vs. 81), and GDS1975 (n\u2009=\u200926 vs. 59). In GDS1815, PLC?1 expression correlates with several known proneural (PN) signature genes; its expression from PN subtype (n\u2009=\u200915) is significantly higher than that from mesenchymal (Mes) subtype (n\u2009=\u200933) HGG. In GDS1962, PLC?1 expression is the highest in nontumor brain tissue (n\u2009=\u200923) and is significantly higher than its expression in grade II gliomas [astrocytomas (n\u2009=\u20097) and oligodendrogliomas (n\u2009=\u200937)]. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve from a REMBRANDT cohort demonstrates that glioma patients with intermediate PLC?1 expression (n\u2009=\u2009103) survived significantly longer than PLC?1 downregulated (2X) groups (n\u2009=\u2009226). From TCGA data, PLC?1 RNA-Seq signal inversely correlates with the pathological grades, and PLC?1 expression in PN (n\u2009=\u20098) is of significantly higher levels than that in Mes (n\u2009=\u20098) subtypes of glioblastoma.

"[""The prognostic factors associated with the survival of glioma patients have not been well established. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of 9p was known to be a typical molecular signature of gliomas, but it was still unclear whether LOH of 9p was associated with poorer survival in patients with gliomas. We searched PubMed and Embase databases from the earliest records to May 2015 to identify studies that met the inclusion criteria. Either a fixed- or a random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled hazard ratio (HR) according to the between-study heterogeneity. Thirteen eligible studies involving 1465 cases of gliomas were included in the meta-analysis. There was little between-study heterogeneity (I 2\u2009=\u200915\xa0%), and the fixed-effects model was used to calculate the pooled HR. Meta-analysis of total 13 studies showed that LOH of 9p was significantly associated with poorer prognosis of glioma patients (HR\u2009=\u20091.39, 95%CI 1.17-1.64, P\u2009=\u20090.0002).

26558632	2016	11	Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen Has an Association with Prognosis and Risks Factors of Cancer Patients: a Systematic Review.	['Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) is reported as a famous marker in various tumors. A couple of articles have been published about the clinical function of PCNA on cancer progression; however, these results are conflicting in some degree. Thus, it is crucial to perform a systematic review and meta-analysis to identify their real actions. Here, we took cervical cancer and glioma as example and then pooled hazard ratios (HRs) or odds ratios (ORs) with 95\xa0% confidence intervals (95\xa0% CIs). In the present study, the PCNA expression in cervical cancer and gliomas patients was both correlated with 5-year-overall survival (OS) (HR\u2009=\u20094.41, 95\xa0% CI 2.71-7.17, p\u2009=\u20090.000; HR\u2009=\u20094.40, 95\xa0% CI 3.00-6.47, p\u2009=\u20090.000; respectively). In addition, a fixed effect model revealed a significant association between PCNA and FIGO stage (OR\u2009=\u20094.48, 95\xa0% CI 3.48-5.77, p\u2009=\u20090.000) or WHO grade (OR\u2009=\u20095.64, 95\xa0% CI 4.15-7.68, p\u2009=\u20090.000), rather than age (OR\u2009=\u20091.01, 95\xa0% CI 0.71-1.43, p\u2009=\u20090.957; OR\u2009=\u20091.00, 95\xa0% CI 0.80-1.24, p\u2009=\u20090.989; respectively). No heterogeneity was observed across all studies. According to funnel plot, no publication bias was reported. In conclusion, our systematic review suggests that PCNA expression is significantly associated with poor 5-year survival, advanced stage or higher WHO grade, which might be suggested as a useful prognostic and diagnostic biomarker, or an effective therapy target in cervical cancer, gliomas, or even more cancers.']	('Lv', 'Qiongying')	Molecular neurobiology	Mol.

"[""Retinoic acid (RA) morphogenetic properties have been used in different kinds of therapies, from neurodegenerative disorders to some types of cancer such as promyelocytic leukemia and neuroblastoma. However, most of the pathways responsible for RA effects remain unknown. To investigate such pathways, we used a RA-induced differentiation model in the human neuroblastoma cells, SH-SY5Y. Our data showed that n-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) reduced cells' proliferation rate and increased cells' sensitivity to RA toxicity. Simultaneously, NAC pre-incubation attenuated nuclear factor erythroid 2-like factor 2 (NRF2) activation by RA. None of these effects were obtained with Trolox® as antioxidant, suggesting a cysteine signalization by RA. NRF2 knockdown increased cell sensibility to RA after 96\xa0h of treatment and diminished neuroblastoma proliferation rate. Conversely, NRF2 overexpression limited RA anti-proliferative effects and increased cell proliferation. In addition, a rapid and non-genomic activation of the ERK 1/2 and PI3K/AKT pathways revealed to be equally required to promote NRF2 activation and necessary for RA-induced differentiation. Together, we provide data correlating NRF2 activity with neuroblastoma proliferation and resistance to RA treatments; thus, this pathway could be a potential target to optimize neuroblastoma chemotherapeutic response as well as in vitro neuronal differentiation protocols.""]"	('de Miranda Ramos', 'Vitor')	Molecular neurobiology	Mol.

27785398	2015	07	Variants in mitochondrial tRNA gene may not be associated with thyroid carcinoma.	"['Thyroid cancer is a very common form of endocrine system malignancy. To date, the molecular mechanism underlying thyroid cancer remains poorly understood. Studies of oncocytic tumors have led to a hypothesis which proposes that defects in oxidative phosphorylation (OX- PHOS) may result in a compensatory increase in mitochondrial replication and gene expression. As a result, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation analysis has become a useful tool to explore the molecular basis of this disease. Among these mutations, mitochondrial transfer RNAs (mttRNAs) are the hot spots for pathogenic mutations associated with thyroid cancer. However, due to its high mutation rate, the role of mt-tRNA variants in thyroid cancer is still controversial. To address this problem, in this study, we reassessed seven reported mt-tRNA variants: tRNAAsp G7521A, tRNAArg T10411C and T10463C, tRNALeu(CUN) A12308G, tRNAIle G4292C and C4312T, and tRNAAla T5655C, in clinical manifestations of thyroid cancer. We first performed the phylogenetic conservation analysis for these variants; moreover, we used a bioinformatic tool to compare the minimum free energy (G) of mt-tRNA with and without mutations. Most strikingly, none of these variants caused the significant change of the G between the wild-type and the mutant form, suggesting that they may not play an important roles in thyroid cancer. In addition, we screened the frequency of the ""pathogenic"" A12308G alternation in 300 patients with thyroid cancer and 200 healthy controls. We found that there were five patients and three control subjects carrying this variant. It seemed that the A12308G variant may be a common polymorphism in the human population. Taken together, our study indicated that variants in mt-tRNA genes may not play active roles in patients with thyroid cancer.']"	('Lv', 'F')	Balkan journal of medical genetics : BJMG	Balkan J. Med.

We have analyzed MBD2 mRNA expression levels in16 patients and 12 controls and the methylation status of stress and toxicity genes in four DNA pools: (i) controls; (ii) newly-diagnosed T2DM patients; (iii) patients with T2DM duration of <5 years and (iv) of >5 years. The MBD2 expression levels were 10.4-times increased on average in T2DM patients compared to controls. Consistent increase in DNA methylation fraction with the increase in T2DM duration was observed in Prdx2 and SCARA3 genes, connected to oxidative stress protection and in BRCA1 and Tp53 tumor-suppressor genes. In conclusion, increased MBD2 expression in patients indicated general dysregulation of DNA methylation in T2DM. The elevated methylation of Prdx2 and SCARA3 genes suggests disturbance in oxidative stress protection in T2DM. The increased methylation of BRCA1 and Tp53 genes unraveled an epigenetic cause for T2DM related increase in cancer risk.']	('Karachanak-Yankova', 'S')	Balkan journal of medical genetics : BJMG	Balkan J.

26597879	2016	11	The effects of spiritual intervention and changes in dopamine receptor gene expression in breast cancer patients.	['Breast cancer is the most common cancer in females in Iran and in most of the developed countries. Studies have shown that having chronic stress in individuals predisposes several types of cancer including breast cancer. Research results showed that spiritual factors correlate with indices of physical consequences such as heart disease, cancer, and death, so do psychiatric conditions and changes in receptor gene expression in depression, anxiety, and social dysfunction. Different studies demonstrated the role of neurotransmitters in occurrence and progression of cancers. They affected cells by their various types of receptors. An effective gene in mental and physical conditions is Dopamine receptor. Accordingly, the study was conducted to evaluate effects of psychotherapy (spiritual intervention) on changes in Dopamine receptor gene expressions in breast cancer patients. 90 female volunteers, including 30 healthy individuals and 60 diagnosed with breast cancer, considering exclusion criteria, were selected for the purpose of the study. The breast cancer patients were further categorized into experimental and control groups of 30 each. Blood samples were collected both prior to and following the spiritual intervention to analyze changes in their dopamine gene receptor expressions. We observed that DRD2-DRD4 in the control group (breast cancer patients) PBMC increased compared to healthy individuals. Also, DRD2-DRD4 in intervention group PBMC decreased compared to the control group and to even lower than those of healthy individuals. The findings were of great significance in management and treatment of cancer because they revealed the possibility of using alternative treatments (e.g., spiritual interventions) apart from conventional medical treatments.']	('Akbari', 'Mohammad Esmael')	Breast cancer (Tokyo, Japan)	Breast Cancer	['eng']

['Our goal is to use automatic data monitoring for reliable prediction of episodes of intracranial hypertension in patients with traumatic brain injury.

We developed the Continuous Hemodynamic Autoregulatory Monitor (CHARM), that siphons and stores signals from existing monitors in the surgical intensive care unit (SICU), efficiently compresses them, and standardizes the search for statistical relationships between any proposed index and adverse events. CHARM uses an automated event detector to reliably locate episodes of elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), while eliminating artifacts within retrospective patient data. A graphical user interface allowed data scanning, selection of criteria for events, and calculating indices. The pressure reactivity index (PRx), defined as the least square linear regression slope of intracranial pressure versus arterial BP, was calculated for a single case that spanned 259\xa0h. CHARM collected continuous records of ABP, ICP, ECG, SpO2, and ventilation from 29 patients with TBI over an 18-month period.

Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using content analysis. The results showed that HCPs experienced that abnormal Pap smear results created anxiety in women, who often sought information from the Internet as a way to cope. Furthermore, the HCPs thought that it was a problem that women chose not to attend investigation, treatment and follow-ups. However, information about the seriousness of abnormal Pap smear results causes women to participate. It is a challenge for HCPs to inform in a reassuring manner.

A meta-analysis of seven of these studies indicated that methylphenidate was superior to placebo for the treatment of CRF. Another meta-analysis of three studies evaluating modafinil found that this drug was no better than placebo. Adverse events were similar between both methylphenidate and modafinil and the placebo groups. Our meta-analysis indicated that the treatment of CRF with methylphenidate appears to be effective, whereas modafinil provides no benefit.

"[""Little is known about the experiences of operable lung cancer patients during treatment in a clinical setting based on fast-track surgery. The study aimed to explore (1) the embodied meaning of illness in patients with operable lung cancer during treatment to 4\xa0months after surgery and (2) patterns of change over time that may affect the patients' daily lives. Twenty patients referred for lung cancer surgery were interviewed three times, corresponding to potential critical transition points following surgery: hospitalisation; hospital-to-home transition; and resumption of daily life activities. Data collection, analysis and interpretation followed a phenomenological hermeneutical approach inspired by Ricoeur and the theoretical framework was grounded in Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology of perception. The findings reveal the process patients went through in regaining familiarity with their own body after lung cancer treatment. Through the post-operative trajectory the patients' resumption of daily activities involved adjusting to a new awareness of everyday life, physical restrictions and their perception of themselves. The findings are expressed in four sub-themes: (1) perceptions of embodied alterations; (2) transformation of embodied structures in the transition from hospital to home was unexpectedly challenging; (3) embodied perceptions of the intersubjective world; and (4) transforming embodied disruptions into bodily awareness. Patients experienced a smooth treatment trajectory regarding physical consequences of illness and treatment which might be due to the fast-track surgery.

26122025	2016	06	Clinicopathological features and prognosis of triple-negative breast cancer: a comparison between younger (<60) and elderly (?60) patients.	['Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) has attracted more attention both clinically and experimentally because of its high-risk biological characteristics and lacking of effective treatment method. The tumour characteristics, patterns of recurrence and metastasis, therapy methods and prognosis in younger TNBC patients have been widely formulated, but the relevant data of the elderly people are lacking. We conducted this retrospective study to compare and analyse the above-related characteristics between the younger and elderly patients with TNBC to estimate the relevance for the elderly TNBC patients. A total of 1489 female patients with primary breast cancer were diagnosed and treated at the department of General Surgery, the Chinese PLA General Hospital, China, from January 2004 to December 2008. In the 1489 patients, 302 patients (20.28%) with TNBC histopathologically confirmed were retrospectively analysed. The 302 TNBC patients were divided into two groups: the younger (<60\xa0years) group and the elderly (?60\xa0years) group. The relevant characteristics of the two groups were compared. There were no statistically significant differences between the two groups in common clinical data of the patients, clinicopathological features of tumour and the features of local recurrences and metastases of tumour, and the 5-year disease-free survival and overall survival were all significantly higher in the elderly group than those in the younger group, although the elderly group patients accepted significantly less radiotherapy and chemotherapy than the younger group patients. The elderly and younger TNBC patients may belong to different subtypes of TNBC and we probably could take a more conservative and cautious attitude in choosing the post-operative adjuvant treatment for the elderly patients with TNBC.']	('Qiu', 'J D')	European journal of cancer care	Eur J Cancer Care (Engl)	['eng']
26110243	2016	06	[Patients' Priorities in the Treatment of Neuroendocrine Tumours: An Analytical Hierarchy Process].	"['Background: Neuroendocrine tumours (NET) are relatively rare, usually slow-growing malignant tumours. So far there are no data on the patient preferences/priorities regarding the therapy for NET. This empirical study aimed at the elicitation of patient priorities in the drug treatment of NET. Method: Qualitative patient interviews (N=9) were conducted. To elicit the patient\'s perspective regarding various treatment aspects of NET a self-administered questionnaire using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was developed. The data collection was carried out using paper questionnaires supported by an item response system in a group discussion. To evaluate the patient-relevant outcomes, the eigenvector method was applied. Results: N=24 patients, experts and relatives participated in the AHP survey. In the AHP all respondents had clear priorities for all considered attributes. The attribute ""overall survival"" was the most significant feature of a drug therapy for all respondents. As in the qualitative interviews, ""efficacy attributes"" dominated the side effects in the AHP as well. The evaluation of all participants thus showed the attributes ""overall survival"" (Wglobal:0.418), ""progression-free survival"" (Wglobal:0.172) and ""response to treatment"" (Wglobal:0.161) to be most relevant. ""Occurrence of abdominal pain"" (Wglobal:0.051) was ranked sixth, with ""tiredness/fatigue"" and ""risk of a hypoglycaemia"" (Wglobal:0.034) in a shared seventh place. Conclusion: The results thus provide evidence about how much influence a treatment capacity has on therapeutic decisions. Using the AHP major aspects of drug therapy from the perspective of those affected were captured, and positive and negative therapeutic properties could be related against each other. Based on the assessment of the patient\'s perspective further investigation must elicit patient preferences for NET drug therapy. In the context of a discrete choice experiment or another choice-based method of preference measurement, the results obtained here can be validated and the therapeutic features weighted according to their preferability.']"	('Mühlbacher', 'A C')	Gesundheitswesen (Bundesverband der Arzte des Offentlichen Gesundheitsdienstes (Germany))	Gesundheitswesen	['ger']

['Hypoxia is a non-physiological level of oxygen tension, a phenomenon common in a majority of malignant tumors. Tumor-hypoxia leads to advanced but dysfunctional vascularization and acquisition of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition phenotype resulting in cell mobility and metastasis. Hypoxia alters cancer cell metabolism and contributes to therapy resistance by inducing cell quiescence. Hypoxia stimulates a complex cell signaling network in cancer cells, including the HIF, PI3K, MAPK, and NF?B pathways, which interact with each other causing positive and negative feedback loops and enhancing or diminishing hypoxic effects. This review provides background knowledge on the role of tumor hypoxia and the role of the HIF cell signaling involved in tumor blood vessel formation, metastasis, and development of the resistance to therapy. Better understanding of the role of hypoxia in cancer progression will open new windows for the discovery of new therapeutics targeting hypoxic tumor cells and hypoxic microenvironment.']	('Muz', 'Barbara')	Hypoxia (Auckland, N.Z.)

['Bone integrity is maintained throughout life via the homeostatic actions of bone cells, namely, osteoclasts, which resorb bone, and osteoblasts, which produce bone. Disruption of this balance in favor of osteoclast activation results in pathological bone loss, which occurs in conditions including osteoporosis, rheumatoid arthritis, primary bone cancer, and cancer metastasis to bone. Hypoxia also plays a major role in these conditions, where it is associated with disease progression and poor prognosis. In recent years, considerable interest has arisen in the mechanisms whereby hypoxia and the hypoxia-inducible transcription factors, HIF-1? and HIF-2?, affect bone remodeling and bone pathologies. This review summarizes the current evidence for hypoxia-mediated regulation of osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity. Role(s) of HIF and HIF target genes in the formation of multinucleated osteoclasts from cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage and in the activation of bone resorption by mature osteoclasts will be discussed. Specific attention will be paid to hypoxic metabolism and generation of ATP by osteoclasts. Hypoxia-driven increases in both glycolytic flux and mitochondrial metabolic activity, along with consequent generation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, have been found to be essential for osteoclast formation and resorption activity. Finally, evidence for the use of HIF inhibitors as potential therapeutic agents targeting bone resorption in osteolytic disease will be discussed.']	('Knowles', 'Helen J')	Hypoxia (Auckland, N.Z.)

['Pleurotus cornucopiae (Oyster mushroom, Tamogitake) has long been eaten as a functional food for enhancement of the immune system, but its effectiveness has not been well confirmed in humans. To this end, we set up a double-blind placebo-controlled human clinical trial to investigate the potential of Oyster mushrooms with respect to the up-regulation of the immune system. The subjects ingested Oyster mushroom extract for 8 weeks. We measured the serum cytokine levels involved in regulation of the immune system, including interferon (IFN)-?, interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-10, IL-12, IL-13, and tumor-necrosis factor (TNF)-?. We found that intake of Oyster mushroom extract elevated IFN-? (P\xa0=\xa00.013) and IL-12, whereas serum levels of IL-10 and IL-13 and other cytokines were minimally changed. We also measured natural killer (NK) cell activity, the levels of which tended to increase, but not significantly. Taken together, these facts suggest that Oyster mushrooms have the potential to enhance the immune system, through Th1 phenotype potentiation as the macrophage-IL-12 - IFN-? pathway. This results in activation of the cell-mediated immune system as exemplified by up-regulation of NK cell activity. Oyster mushroom extract may be beneficial for the prevention of various diseases, including infectious diseases and cancer, due to its stimulation of the immune system.']	('Tanaka', 'Aiko')	Journal of traditional and complementary medicine	J Tradit Complement Med	['eng']
27774388	2016	11	A Nanosystem Capable of Releasing a Photosensitizer Bioprecursor under Two-Photon Irradiation for Photodynamic Therapy.	"[""The applications of photodynamic therapy (PDT) are usually limited by photosensitizers' side effects and singlet oxygen's short half-life. Herein, a mitochondria-targeted nanosystem is demonstrated to enhance the PDT efficacy by releasing a bio-precursor of photosensitizer under two-photon irradiation. A phototriggerable coumarin derivative is first synthesized by linking 5-aminolevulinic acid (5-ALA, the bio-precursor) to coumarin; and the nanosystem (CD-ALA-TPP) is then fabricated by covalently incorporating this coumarin derivative and a mitochondria-targeting compound triphenylphosphonium (TPP) onto carbon dots (CDs). Upon cellular internalization, the nanosystem preferentially accumulates in mitochondria; and under one- or two-photon irradiation, it releases 5-ALA molecules that are then metabolized into protoporphyrin IX in mitochondria through a series of biosynthesis processes. The subsequent red light irradiation induces this endogenously synthesized photosensitizer to generate singlet oxygen, thereby causing oxidant damage to mitochondria and then the apoptosis of the cells. Analysis via 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assays indicate that the novel PDT system exhibits enhanced cytotoxicity toward cancer cells. This study may offer a new strategy for designing PDT systems with high efficacy and low side effects.""]"	('Wu', 'Hao')	Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)	Adv Sci (Weinh)	['eng']

['Cancer chemotherapy has been impeded by side effects and multidrug resistance (MDR) partially caused by drug efflux from cancer cells, which call for targeted drug delivery systems additionally able to circumvent MDR. Here we report multifunctional DNA nanoflowers (NFs) for targeted drug delivery to both chemosensitive and MDR cancer cells and circumvent MDR in both leukemia and breast cancer cell models. NFs are self-assembled via liquid crystallization of DNA generated by Rolling Circle Replication, during which NFs are incorporated with aptamers for specific cancer cell recognition, fluorophores for bioimaging, and Doxorubicin (Dox)-binding DNA for drug delivery. NF sizes are tunable (down to ~200 nm in diameter), and the densely packed drug-binding motifs and porous intrastructures endow NFs with high drug loading capacity (71.4%, wt/wt). The Dox-loaded NFs (NF-Dox) are stable at physiological pH, yet drug release is facilitated in acidic or basic conditions. NFs deliver Dox into target chemosensitive and MDR cancer cells, preventing drug efflux and enhancing drug retention in MDR cells. Consequently, NF-Dox induces potent cytotoxicity in both target chemosensitive cells and MDR cells, but not nontarget cells, thus concurrently circumventing MDR and reducing side effects. Overall, these NFs are promising to circumvent MDR in targeted cancer therapy.']	('Mei', 'Lei')	Nano research	Nano Res	['eng']
27774032	2015	11	Efficacy and effectiveness trials have different goals, use different tools, and generate different messages.	['The discussion about the optimal design of clinical trials reflects the perspectives of theory-based scientists and practice-based clinicians. Scientists compare the theory with published results.

They observe a mixture of what they want and what they get. None of them can solve the problem without the support of the other. Here, we summarize the results of discussions with scientists and clinicians. All participants were interested to understand and analyze the arguments of the other side. As a result of this process, we conclude that scientists tell what they see, a continuum from clear explanatory to clear pragmatic trials. Clinicians tell what they want to see, a clear explanatory trial to describe the expected effects under ideal study conditions and a clear pragmatic trial to describe the observed effects under real-world conditions. Following this discussion, the solution was not too difficult. When we accept what we see, we will not get what we want. If we discuss a necessary change of management, we will end up with the conclusion that two types of studies are necessary to demonstrate efficacy and effectiveness. Efficacy can be demonstrated in an explanatory, ie, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) completed under ideal study conditions. Effectiveness can be demonstrated in an observational, ie, a pragmatic controlled trial (PCT) completed under real-world conditions.

26282626	2017	08	Changes in impaired self-awareness after acquired brain injury in patients following intensive neuropsychological rehabilitation.	['The objective of this study was to investigate changes in self-awareness impairments in outpatients with acquired brain injury (ABI) and the effects these changes have on rehabilitation. Participants were 78 patients with ABI (8.3 years post-injury) who followed an intensive outpatient neuropsychological rehabilitation programme. This longitudinal study comprised pre (T1) and post (T2) measurements and a one-year follow-up (T3). Thirty-eight patients completed the study. The main outcome domains were self-awareness, depressive symptoms, psychological and physical dysfunction, and health-related quality of life (HRQoL). Patients were divided into three awareness groups: underestimation, accurate estimation, and overestimation of competencies. Most patients who underestimated their competencies at the start of treatment accurately estimated their competencies directly after treatment (9 out of 11 patients). These patients also exhibited the largest treatment effects regarding depressive symptoms, psychological and physical dysfunction, and HRQoL. Most patients with impaired self-awareness (i.e., overestimation of competencies) at the start of treatment continued to overestimate their competencies after treatment (10 out of 14 patients). These patients exhibited a significant decrease in depressive symptoms but no other treatment effects. The results indicate that changes in outcome are related to changes in awareness, which underline the importance of taking into account different awareness groups with respect to treatment effects.']	('Smeets', 'Sanne M J')	Neuropsychological rehabilitation	Neuropsychol Rehabil	['eng']
26277620	2016	08	Antioxidant activity of chemically synthesized AgNPs and biosynthesized Pongamia pinnata leaf extract mediated AgNPs - A comparative study.	['Biosynthesis of metal nanoparticles is the present research in the limb of nanotechnology which reduces the toxicity of metal nanoparticles. Green chemistry approach emphasizes that the usage of plant material has offered a reliable, simple, nontoxic and eco-friendly that links Nanotechnology and Biotechnology. Increasing environmental concerns over chemical synthesis routes have resulted in attempts to develop bio-mimetic approaches. The current study deals with novel method for biosynthesis of AgNPs using Pongamia pinnata leaf extract as reducing agent. These biosynthesized nanoparticles were characterized with the help of UV-vis Spectroscopy, Photoluminescence (PL) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), X-ray diffraction (XRD), Atomic force microscopy (AFM), Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and Zeta Potential (ZP). Free radical scavenging potential of P. pinnata synthesized silver nanoparticles was evaluated in vitro by using five different assays viz., DPPH, ABT+S, Hydroxyl, Superoxide anion and Nitric oxide scavenging assays are also adopted. Capping of AgNPs by various polyphenolic compounds present in P. pinnata leaf extract appears to be a major contributor to lower toxicity compared to chemically synthesized AgNPs. The surface plasmon resonance shows 425nm and grain size of the AgNPs was measured from XRD and FTIR revealed the bioconjucation of AgNPs. The in vitro antioxidant activity of AgNPs showed a significant effect on scavenging of free radicals. The results suggest that the silver nanoparticles from P. pinnata can be potent natural antioxidants and can be essential for health preservation against oxidative stress related degenerative diseases, such as cancer. The vitality of this study lies in the formation of silver nanoparticles by utilizing the wealth of global ecological resources, eliminating obnoxious and toxic reagents which are hazardous to be handled as well as to be applied.']	('Priya', 'R Sathiya')	Ecotoxicology and environmental safety	Ecotoxicol.

['Errorless learning has demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of memory impairment in adults and older adults with acquired brain injury. In the same population, use of elaborative encoding through supported self-generation in errorless paradigms has been shown to further enhance memory performance. However, the evidence base relevant to application of both standard and self-generation forms of errorless learning in children is far weaker. We address this limitation in the present study to examine recall performance in children with brain injury (n\u2009=\u200916) who were taught novel age-appropriate science and social science facts through the medium of Skype. All participants were taught these facts under conditions of standard errorless learning, errorless learning with self-generation, and trial-and-error learning after which memory was tested at 5-minute, 30-minute, 1-hour and 24-hour delays. Analysis revealed no main effect of time, with participants retaining most information acquired over the 24-hour testing period, but a significant effect of condition. Notably, self-generation proved more effective than both standard errorless and trial-and-error learning. Further analysis of the data revealed that severity of attentional impairment was less detrimental to recall performance under errorless conditions. This study extends the literature to provide further evidence of the value of errorless learning methods in children with ABI and the first demonstration of the effectiveness of self-generation when delivered via the Internet.']	('Haslam', 'Catherine')	Neuropsychological rehabilitation	Neuropsychol Rehabil	['eng']

['Bovine papillomavirus type 13 (BPV-13), a novel Deltapapillomavirus, has been found associated with urothelial tumours of the urinary bladder of cattle grazing on lands infested with bracken fern. BPV-13 was detected in 28 of 39 urothelial tumours. Diagnosis was based on sequencing of L1 and E5 amplicons from tumour samples. The nucleotide sequences generated from these amplicons showed a 100% homology with the sequences of BPV-13 L1 and E5 DNA found in Brazil from a fibropapilloma of the ear in a cow and from equine sarcoids in two horses. GenBank accession number of our representative BPV-13 sequences is JQ798171.1. Furthermore, mRNA encoding BPV-13 E5 oncoprotein was also documented, and its expression was also shown by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence in the basal and suprabasal urothelial tumour cells. In twenty-three tumours, BPV-13 was simultaneously found with BPV-2, a Deltapapillomavirus genus, species 4. The latter virus was detected by amplifying and sequencing a 154-bp-sized DNA fragment of BPV-2 E5. In addition, BPV-13 by itself was seen to be expressed in five BPV-2-negative urothelial tumours. This study shows that BPV-13 is present in urothelial tumour cells thus sharing biological properties with BPV-1 and BPV-2. Although further studies are needed, BPV-13 appears to be another worldwide infectious agent responsible for a distressing disease causing severe economic losses in cattle industry.']	('Roperto', 'S')	Transboundary and emerging diseases	Transbound Emerg Dis	['eng']

['Several Eastern Mediterranean (EM) countries, including Jordan, suffer from high smoking prevalence but weak implementation of smoking bans (SB). Public support (PS) influences successful implementation of SB, but little is known about PS for SB in EM countries with weak SB implementation. We conducted a cross-sectional survey measuring knowledge and perceptions of a large purposive sample of the Jordanian public regarding tobacco harms and anti-tobacco laws. Among 1169 respondents, 46% of whom used tobacco, PS for SB varied from 98% to 39% based on venue, being highest for health facilities and lowest for coffee shops. In venues with relatively lower PS (restaurants, coffee shops), lower educational groups, older age groups, nonsmokers, and those who had more knowledge regarding tobacco and secondhand smoke harms were significantly more likely to support SB than the highest educational group, the youngest age group, smokers, and those who had less knowledge (respectively). Our results suggest that aggressive promotion of SB is needed in countries like Jordan (where smoking is increasing), tailored to venue and specific sociodemographic characteristics of the public accessing these venues, particularly restaurants and coffee shops.

26108557	2016	10	Understanding central carbon metabolism of rapidly proliferating mammalian cells based on analysis of key enzymatic activities in GS-CHO cell lines.	['The central carbon metabolism (glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway [PPP], and the tricarboxylic acid [TCA] cycle) plays an essential role in the supply of biosynthetic precursors and energy. How the central carbon metabolism changes with the varying growth rates in the in vitro cultivation of rapidly proliferating mammalian cells, such as cancer cells and continuous cell lines for recombinant protein production, remains elusive. Based on relationships between the growth rate and the activity of seven key enzymes from six cell clones, this work reports finding an important metabolic characteristic in rapidly proliferating glutamine synthetase-Chinese hamster ovary cells. The key enzymatic activity involved in the TCA cycle that is responsible for the supply of energy became elevated as the growth rate exhibited increases, while the activity of key enzymes in metabolic pathways (glycolysis and the PPP), responsible for the supply of biosynthetic precursors, tended to decrease-suggesting that rapidly proliferating cells still depended predominantly on the TCA cycle rather than on aerobic glycolysis for their energetic demands. Meanwhile, the growth-limiting resource was most likely biosynthetic substrates rather than energy provision. In addition, the multifaceted role of glucose-6-phosphate isomerase (PGI) was confirmed, based on a significant correlation between PGI activity and the percentage of G2/M-phase cells.']	('Zou', 'Wu')	Biotechnology and applied biochemistry	Biotechnol.

This mechanism is regulated via interfering Ras and p38 signal transduction. Moreover, disrupting VEGF and integrin-signaling cascade by bioactive agents are the predictable mechanisms that cause the decreasing of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity.

25846798	2016	04	Cytotoxic response of platinum-coated gold nanorods in human breast cancer cells at very low exposure levels.	['Because of unique optical behavior gold nanorods (GNRs) have attracted attention for the application in biomedical field such as bio-sensing, bio-imaging and hyperthermia. However, toxicological response of GNRs is controversial due to their different surface coating. Therefore, a comprehensive knowledge about toxicological profile of GNRs is necessary before their biomedical applications. First time, we investigated the toxic response of GNRs coated with platinum (GNRs-Pt) in human breast carcinoma (MCF-7) cells. Platinum coating further improves the optical and catalytic properties of GNRs. Assays such as 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT), neutral red uptake (NRU) and lactate dehydroganase (LDH) assays have shown that GNRs-Pt induced cytotoxicity at very low exposure levels (0.1-0.8 ?g\xa0mL-1 ). Accumulation of cells in SubG1 phase and low mitochondrial membrane potential (JC-1 probe) in treated cells suggest that GNRs-Pt induced cell death via apoptotic pathway. Quantitative real-time PCR data demonstrated that mRNA expression of apoptotic genes (bax, caspase-3 and caspase-9) were up-regulated while anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 was down-regulated in cells exposed to GNRs-Pt. We further observed the higher activity of caspase-3 and caspase-9 enzymes in GNRs-Pt treated cells supporting mRNA data. Moreover, N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) significantly attenuated the ROS generation and cytotoxicity induced by GNRs-Pt in MCF-7 cells suggesting that ROS might plays a crucial role in GNRs-Pt induced toxicity. This study warns of possible toxicity of GNRs even at very low exposure levels.

27747840	2015	01	A tutorial on oxidative stress and redox signaling with application to exercise and sedentariness.	['Oxidative stress has been shown to play a role in the etiology of several chronic diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes mellitus, and cancer. Free radicals and, most prominently, the superoxide radical, result from oxidative metabolism and several enzyme-catalyzed reactions, and endogenous cellular antioxidants dismutate many reactive oxygen species (ROS). Under certain conditions, ROS production can outpace dismutation (e.g., long-term sedentariness and positive energy balance) and the result is oxidative stress, with proteins, lipids, and DNA the most common targets of radicals. However, the molecules that contribute to oxidative stress also appear to participate in vital cell signaling activity that supports health and stimulates favorable adaptations to exercise training, such that inhibiting ROS formation prevents common adaptations to training. Furthermore, researchers have recently suggested that some proteins are not as readily formed when the redox state of the cell is insufficiently oxidative. Exercise training appears to optimize the redox environment by dramatically enhancing the capacity of the cell to neutralize ROS while regularly creating oxidative environments in which membrane and secretory proteins can be synthesized. The role that exercise plays in enhancing management of ROS likely explains many of the associated health benefits.']	('Buresh', 'Robert')	Sports medicine - open	Sports Med Open	['eng']

Following surgery, oral rehabilitation was attempted using an implant-supported overdenture on a gold bar retainer splinting four implants. However, the patient was not satisfied with this prosthesis because of mucosal pain and discomfort, and she gradually ceased its use. Consequently, contact with the opposing teeth caused wear of the prosthetic screws. We elected to replace the implant-supported overdenture with an implant-fixed prosthesis approximately 16 years after insertion of the overdenture to prevent further wear of the prosthetic screws. The patient was highly satisfied with the improved stability of the implant-fixed prosthesis.

To tackle this problem, Pluronic F68-CUR (F68-CUR) conjugate micelles, which are amphiphilic copolymers, were designed and synthesized in this study. These highly stable micelles with CUR concentrated in the core were formulated using the solvent evaporation method and were confirmed by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. Physicochemical characterization of F68-CUR conjugate micelles revealed that high drug loading content (DL%; 0.248\u2009mg CUR/1\u2009mg F68) was achieved, and the average particle size of micelles was 115.2\u2009±\u20093.0\u2009nm.

The IC50 value of F68-CUR conjugate micelles was 1.95-fold lower than that of free CUR, indicating that the anti-cancer activity of CUR was significantly improved in the micelles. Furthermore, apoptotic studies demonstrated that F68-CUR conjugate micelles induced more cell apoptosis than that of free CUR. Taken together, these results demonstrate that F68-CUR conjugate micelles are promising to improve the clinical effectiveness of CUR in cancer treatment.']	('Cai', 'Yuee')	Drug delivery	Drug Deliv	['eng']

['P-glycoprotein (P-gp) efflux is the major cause of multidrug resistance (MDR) in tumors when using anticancer drugs, moreover, poor bioavailability of few drugs is also due to P-gp efflux in the gut. Rapamycin (RPM) is in the clinical trials for breast cancer treatment, but its P-gp substrate property leads to poor oral bioavailability and efficacy. The objective of this study is to formulate and evaluate nanoparticles of RPM, along with a chemosensitizer (piperine, PIP) for improved oral bioavailability and efficacy. Poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) was selected as polymer as it has moderate MDR reversal activity, which may provide additional benefits. The nanoprecipitation method was used to prepare PLGA nanoparticles with particle size below 150\u2009nm, loaded with both drugs (RPM and PIP). Prepared nanoparticles showed sustained in vitro drug release for weeks, with initial release kinetics of zero order with non-Fickian transport, subsequently followed by Higuchi kinetics with Fickian diffusion. An everted gut sac method was used to study the effect of P-gp efflux on drug transport. This reveals that the uptake of the RPM (P-gp substrate) has been increased in the presence of chemosensitizer. Pharmacokinetic studies showed better absorption profile of RPM from polymeric nanoparticles compared to its suspension counterpart and improved bioavailability of 4.8-folds in combination with a chemosensitizer.

25805255	2016	03	A geospatial approach to the prediction of indoor radon vulnerability in British Columbia, Canada.	['Radon is a carcinogenic radioactive gas produced by the decay of uranium. Accumulation of radon in residential structures contributes to lung cancer mortality. The goal of this research is to predict residential radon vulnerability classes for the province of British Columbia (BC) at aggregated spatial units. Spatially referenced indoor radon concentration data were partitioned into low, medium, and high classes of radon vulnerability. Radon vulnerability classes were then linked to environmental and housing data derived from existing geospatial datasets. A Balanced Random Forests algorithm was used to model environmental predictors of indoor radon vulnerability and values at un-sampled locations across BC. A model was generated and evaluated using accuracy, precision, and kappa statistics. The influence of predictor variables was investigated through variable importance and partial dependence plots. The model performed 34% better than a random classifier. Increased probabilities of high vulnerability were associated with cold and dry winters, close proximity to major river systems, and fluvioglacial and colluvial soil parent materials. The Kootenays and Columbia-Shuswap regions were most at risk. Here, we present a novel method for predictive radon mapping that is broadly applicable to regions throughout the world.']	('Branion-Calles', 'Michael C')	Journal of exposure science & environmental epidemiology	J Expo Sci Environ Epidemiol	['eng']

['Archaeosomes as liposomes made with one or more ether lipids that are unique to the domain of Archaeobacteria, found in Archaea constitute a novel family of liposome. Achaean-type lipids consist of archaeol (diether) and/or caldarchaeol (tetraether) core structures. Archaeosomes can be produced using standard procedures (hydrated film submitted to sonication, extrusion and detergent dialysis) at any temperature in the physiological range or lower, therefore making it possible to encapsulate thermally stable compounds. Various physiological as well as environmental factors affect its stability. Archaeosomes are widely used as drug delivery systems for cancer vaccines, Chagas disease, proteins and peptides, gene delivery, antigen delivery and delivery of natural antioxidant compounds.

['The conjugation of tunable peptides or materials with nanocarriers represents a promising approach for drug delivery to tumor cells. In this study, we report the development of a novel liposomal carrier system that exploits the cell surface binding synergism between photo-sensitive peptides (PSPs) and targeting ligands. The positive charges of the lysine residues on the cell-penetrating peptides (CPPs) were temporarily caged by the photolabile-protective groups (PG), thereby forming a PSP. Furthermore, this PSP enhances specific uptake into cancer cells after rapidly uncaging the PG via near-infrared (NIR) light illumination. In the circulatory system, the cell penetrability of PSP was hindered. In contrast, the asparagine-glycine-arginine (NGR) peptide moieties, selectively bind to CD13-positive tumors, were attached to the nanocarrier to facilitate the active accumulation of this liposomal carrier in tumor tissue. The dual-modified liposomes (PSP/NGR-L) were prepared by emulsification method, and the concentrations of DSPE-PEG2000-psCPP and DSPE-PEG5000-NGR in the liposomes were chosen to be 4% and 1% (molar ratio), respectively. The mean particle size of the PSP/NGR-L was about 95\u2009nm, and the drug entrapment efficiency was more than 90%. Cellular uptake results demonstrated that the proposed PSP/NGR-L had an enhancement of cancer cell recognition and specific uptake.

Hormonal effects have been suggested as a possible explanation for these differences but there is a scarcity of evidence on these relationships. Our objective was to examine the relationship between reproductive factors and asthma risk among females and to examine whether body mass index (BMI) modifies this relationship. Female participants in the 2004 fifth decade follow-up postal survey of the Tasmanian Longitudinal Health Study formed the study population. Reproductive history and data on hormonal contraceptive (HC) use were collected on 2764 females. Multiple logistic regression was used to assess the association between the reproductive factors and current asthma. The mean age of participants was 43\u2005years and the prevalence of middle-aged current asthma was 12.8%. Females with very early menarche (?10\u2005years) had higher odds of middle-aged current asthma (OR 1.91, 95% CI 1.14-3.2). Pregnancy history (number of births and age at first pregnancy) were not associated with current asthma risk at 44\u2005years. Ever having used HCs, years of use and age started using HCs were not individually associated with current asthma risk. However, body mass index significantly modified the relationship between HC use and asthma. We found increasing years of pill use was associated with a significantly increased risk of current asthma in overweight/obese women but a reduced risk in normal weight women (interaction p=0.015). Hormonal effects from use of HCs and early menarche may contribute to the sex differential in asthma risk. Our findings suggest that in obese women with a history of long-term HC use may be at an increased risk of chronic respiratory disease, and regular monitoring for asthma and asthma symptoms may be recommended.']	('Matheson', 'Melanie C')	ERJ open research	ERJ Open Res	['eng']

['Copper sulfide nanoparticles (CuS NPs) have been reported as a single-compartment theranostic nanosystem to visualize and treat tumors simultaneously. However, few studies have investigated the in vivo tumor-targeted delivery of this class of nanoparticles. In this study, we introduced a tumor-specific targeting ligand, folic acid (FA), onto the surface of CuS NPs as a model system to demonstrate the feasibility of actively targeted CuS NPs for positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and PET image-guided photothermal therapy (PTT). A one-pot synthetic method was used for introducing FA to CuS NPs to yield FA-CuS NPs. Biodistribution studies in mice bearing folate receptor-expressing KB tumor showed significantly higher tumor uptake of FA-CuS NPs than non-targeted polyethylene glycol (PEG)-coated PEG-CuS NPs after intravenous injection. Moreover, tumor uptake of FA-CuS NPs could be effectively blocked by free FA. Biodistribution and clearance of 64Cu-labeled FA-CuS NPs (FA-[64Cu]CuS NPs) could be readily visualized by microPET (?PET), which confirmed a significantly higher level of tumor uptake of FA-[64Cu]CuS NPs than non-targeted PEG-[64Cu]CuS NPs. ?PET image-guided PTT with FA-CuS NPs mediated substantially greater tumor damage compared with PTT mediated by PEG-CuS NPs. Thus, FA-CuS NPs is a promising candidate for PTT of folate receptor-positive tumors.']	('Zhou', 'Min')	Journal of materials chemistry.

['Molecular oxygen (O2) plays a key role in many physiological processes, and becomes a toxicant to kill cells when excited to 1O2. Intracellular O2 levels, or the degree of hypoxia, are always viewed as an indicator of cancers. Due to the highly efficient cancer therapy ability and low side effect, photodynamic therapy (PDT) becomes one of the most promising treatments for cancers. Herein, an early-stage diagnosis and therapy system is reported based on the phosphorescent conjugated polymer dots (Pdots) containing Pt(II) porphyrin as an oxygen-responsive phosphorescent group and 1O2 photosensitizer. Intracellular hypoxia detection has been investigated. Results show that cells treated with Pdots display longer lifetimes under hypoxic conditions, and time-resolved luminescence images exhibit a higher signal-to-noise ratio after gating off the short-lived background fluorescence. Quantification of O2 is realized by the ratiometric emission intensity of phosphorescence/fluorescence and the lifetime of phosphorescence. Additionally, the PDT efficiency of Pdots is estimated by flow cytometry, MTT cell viability assay, and in situ imaging of PDT induced cell death. Interestingly, Pdots exhibit a high PDT efficiency and would be promising in clinical applications.']	('Zhou', 'Xiaobo')	Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)	Adv Sci (Weinh)	['eng']

['Aberrant methylation of DNA is a common event in the development of cancers, including squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the human esophagus. In the present study, we determined: (a) whether aberrant DNA methylation also occurs in the development of N-nitrosomethylbenzylamine (NMBA)-induced tumorigenesis in the rat esophagus, a model of human esophageal SCC; and (b) if so, whether dietary black raspberries (BRBs) are capable of preventing this aberrant DNA methylation. A diet containing 5% BRBs inhibited the development of NMBA-induced tumors in the rat esophagus. This inhibition was associated with reduced mRNA levels of the DNA methyltransferases, Dnmt1 and Dnmt3b, in both dysplastic lesions and in papillomas of the esophagus. In addition, promoter methylation of Sfrp4, a WNT pathway antagonist, was significantly reduced by the berry diet, and this was associated with decreased nuclear localization of ?-CATENIN and reduced expression of c-MYC protein in NMBA-treated esophagi. Decreased promoter methylation of Sfrp4 correlated with decreased expression of Dmnt3b and, ultimately, with increased Sfrp4 mRNA expression. This suggests that epigenetic alterations in NMBA-induced rat esophageal tumorigenesis recapitulate epigenetic events in human esophageal SCC, and that BRBs could be useful in preventing the aberrant DNA methylation involved in the development of human esophageal SCC. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']	('Huang', 'Yi-Wen')	Molecular carcinogenesis	Mol.

An increasing number of pharmacologic agents targeting cancer cell death via autophagy mechanisms are being evaluated in hopes of circumventing apoptotic and therapeutic resistance. We report for the first time, loss of Beclin-1, a key mediator of autophagy, was significantly linked to prognostic factors in EAC. Specifically, Beclin-1 expression loss occurred in 49.0% of EAC patients versus 4.8% of controls. There was a significant inverse correlation between loss of Beclin-1 with histologic grade and tumor stage supporting a tumor suppressive role for Beclin-1. Autophagy modulation linked to cell death was examined in EAC cell lines following treatment with a proanthocyanidin-rich cranberry extract, C-PAC, and the commonly used autophagy inducer, rapamycin. C-PAC induced Beclin-1-independent autophagy in EAC cells characterized by reduced phosphorylation at serine 15 and 93, and significant cell death induction. In contrast, rapamycin-induced autophagy resulted in concomitant, increases in total Beclin-1 levels as well as Beclin-1-phosphorylation in a cell line specific manner, leading to long-term cell survival. Furthermore, autophagic LC3-II was induced by C-PAC following siRNA suppression of Beclin-1 in EAC cells. Together these data support a prognostic role of Beclin-1 in EAC with evidence that Beclin-dependent autophagy induction is agent specific.

Incidence and severity of radiationinduced changes within the teeth individually vary depending on the patient's age, actual radiation dose, size of radiation exposure field, patient's general condition and additional risk factors. Inadequately managed treatment of caries may lead to loss of teeth, as well as prove instrumental in tangibly diminishing individual quality of life in patients. Furthermore, the need to have the teeth deemed unyielding or unsuitable for the application of conservative methods of treatment duly extracted is fraught for a patient with an extra hazard of developing osteoradionecrosis (ORN), while also increasing all attendant therapeutic expenditures. The present paper aims to offer some practical insights into currently available methods of preventing likely development of radiation-induced caries.""]"	('Dobro?', 'Katarzyna')	Contemporary oncology (Poznan, Poland)	Contemp Oncol (Pozn)	['eng']

27672682	2015	03	Single-View Food Portion Estimation Based on Geometric Models.	['In this paper we present a food portion estimation technique based on a single-view food image used for the estimation of the amount of energy (in kilocalories) consumed at a meal. Unlike previous methods we have developed, the new technique is capable of estimating food portion without manual tuning of parameters. Although single-view 3D scene reconstruction is in general an ill-posed problem, the use of geometric models such as the shape of a container can help to partially recover 3D parameters of food items in the scene. Based on the estimated 3D parameters of each food item and a reference object in the scene, the volume of each food item in the image can be determined. The weight of each food can then be estimated using the density of the food item. We were able to achieve an error of less than 6% for energy estimation of an image of a meal assuming accurate segmentation and food classification.']	('Fang', 'Shaobo')	ISM ... : ...

27656339	2015	09	Niche construction game cancer cells play.	['Niche construction concept was originally defined in evolutionary biology as the continuous interplay between natural selection via environmental conditions and the modification of these conditions by the organism itself. Processes unraveling during cancer metastasis include construction of niches, which cancer cells use towards more efficient survival, transport into new environments and preparation of the remote sites for their arrival. Many elegant experiments were done lately illustrating, for example, the premetastatic niche construction, but there is practically no mathematical modeling done which would apply the niche construction framework. To create models useful for understanding niche construction role in cancer progression, we argue that a) genetic, b) phenotypic and c) ecological levels are to be included. While the model proposed here is phenomenological in its current form, it can be converted into a predictive outcome model via experimental measurement of the model parameters. Here we give an overview of an experimentally formulated problem in cancer metastasis and propose how niche construction framework can be utilized and broadened to model it. Other life science disciplines, such as host-parasite coevolution, may also benefit from niche construction framework adaptation, to satisfy growing need for theoretical considerations of data collected by experimental biology.']	('Bergman', 'Aviv')	European physical journal plus	Eur Phys J Plus	['eng']

We studied the interaction between Th22 cells and colon cancer cells in the colon cancer microenvironment. Colon cancer proliferation was examined by flow cytometry analysis and H(3) thymidine incorporation. Cell cycle related genes were quantified by real-time PCR and Western blotting. We transfected colon cancer cells with lentiviral vector encoding specific gene shRNAs and used chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay to determine the genetic signaling involved in interleukin (IL)-22-mediated colon cancer cell proliferation. We showed that Th22 cells released IL-22 and stimulated colon cancer proliferation. Mechanistically, IL-22 activated STAT3, and subsequently STAT3 bound to the promoter areas of the Polycomb Repression complex 2 (PRC2) components SUZ12 and EED, and stimulated the expression of PRC2. Consequently, the activated PRC2 catalyzed the promoters of the cell cycle check-point genes p16 and p21, and inhibited their expression through H3K27me3-mediated histone methylation, and ultimately caused colon cancer cell proliferation.

27622011	2016	08	Combined treatment with dabrafenib and trametinib with immune-stimulating antibodies for BRAF mutant melanoma.	['The combination of targeted therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors has become the standard of care in patients with BRAF (V600E) mutant melanoma, but responses are not durable. In addition, the impressive clinical benefits with anti-PD-1 and anti-PD-L1 antibodies (Ab) in patients with heavily pretreated metastatic melanoma and the synergistic effect of dabrafenib, trametinib and anti-PD-1 compared with single therapy alone groups support the idea that combining dabrafenib, trametinib and immunotherapy based on PD-1 blockade could be an interesting approach in the treatment of metastatic melanoma. With our mouse model of syngeneic BRAF (V600E) driven melanoma (SM1), we tested whether the addition of an immunostimulatory Ab targeting CD137 (4-1BB) and/or CD134 (OX40) would enhance the antitumor effect of dabrafenib, trametinib and anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy. In vitro studies showed that the combination group of dabrafenib, trametinib and anti-PD-1 increases CD8(+) tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), as well as CD4(+) T cells and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). An upregulation of PD-L1 was observed in the combination of dabrafenib, trametinib and anti-PD-1 therapy. Combination of dabrafenib, trametinib and anti-PD-1, with either anti-CD137 or anti-CD134, showed a superior antitumor effect, but the five-agent combination was not superior to the four-agent combinations. In conclusion, the combination of dabrafenib, trametinib, anti-PD1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy results in robust antitumor activity, which is further improved by adding the immune-stimulating Ab anti-CD137 or anti-CD134. Our findings support the testing of these combinations in patients with BRAF (V600E) mutant metastatic melanoma.']	('Homet Moreno', 'Blanca')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

27617925	2015	05	Targeting Viral Entry for Treatment of Hepatitis B and C Virus Infections.	['Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections remain major health problems worldwide, with 400-500 million chronically infected people worldwide. Chronic infection results in liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, the second leading cause of cancer death. Current treatments for HBV limit viral replication without efficiently curing infection. HCV treatment has markedly progressed with the licensing of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) for HCV cure, yet limited access for the majority of patients is a major challenge. Preventative and curative treatment strategies, aimed at novel targets, are needed for both viruses. Viral entry represents one such target, although detailed knowledge of the entry mechanisms is a prerequisite. For HBV, the recent discovery of the NTCP cell entry factor enabled the establishment of an HBV cell culture model and showed that cyclosporin A and Myrcludex B are NTCP-targeting entry inhibitors. Advances in the understanding of HCV entry revealed it to be a complex process involving many factors, offering several antiviral targets. These include viral envelope proteins E1 and E2, virion-associated lipoprotein ApoE, and cellular factors CD81, SRBI, EGFR, claudin-1, occludin, and the cholesterol transporter NPC1L1. Small molecules targeting SR-BI, EGFR, and NPC1L1 have entered clinical trials, whereas other viral- and host-targeted small molecules, peptides, and antibodies show promise in preclinical models. This review summarizes the current understanding of HBV and HCV entry and describes novel antiviral targets and compounds in different stages of clinical development. Overall, proof-of-concept studies indicate that entry inhibitors are a promising class of antivirals to prevent and treat HBV and HCV infections.']	('Colpitts', 'Che C')	ACS infectious diseases	ACS Infect Dis	['eng']

"[""Pediatric cancer caregivers are typically present at their child's frequent, invasive treatments, and such treatments elicit substantial distress. Yet, variability exists in how even the most anxious caregivers cope. Here we examined one potential source of this variability: caregivers' tendencies to self-distance when reflecting on their feelings surrounding their child's treatments. We measured caregivers' self-distancing and trait anxiety at baseline, anticipatory anxiety during their child's treatment procedures, and psychological distress and avoidance three months later. Self-distancing buffered high (but not low) trait anxious caregivers against short- and long-term distress without promoting avoidance. These findings held when controlling for other buffers, highlighting the unique benefits of self-distancing. These results identify a coping process that buffers vulnerable caregivers against a chronic life stressor while also demonstrating the ecological validly of laboratory research on self-distancing. Future research is needed to explicate causality and the cognitive and physiological processes that mediate these results.""]"	('Penner', 'Louis A')	Clinical psychological science : a journal of the Association for Psychological Science	Clin Psychol Sci	['eng']

['Wheat is the most important staple crop in temperate zones and is in increasing demand in countries undergoing urbanization and industrialization. In addition to being a major source of starch and energy, wheat also provides substantial amounts of a number of components which are essential or beneficial for health, notably protein, vitamins (notably B vitamins), dietary fiber, and phytochemicals. Of these, wheat is a particularly important source of dietary fiber, with bread alone providing 20% of the daily intake in the UK, and well-established relationships between the consumption of cereal dietary fiber and reduced risk of cardio-vascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and forms of cancer (notably colo-rectal cancer). Wheat shows high variability in the contents and compositions of beneficial components, with some (including dietary fiber) showing high heritability.

Majority of those regulate immunological, gastrointestinal, hormonal and neurological responses, thereby playing a vital role in the prevention of cancer, osteoporosis, hypertension and other disorders as discussed in this review. For the commercial production of such novel bioactive peptides large scale technologies based on membrane separation and ion exchange chromatography methods have been developed. Separation and identification of those peptides and their pharmacodynamic parameters are necessary to transfer their potent functional properties into food applications.

The position of the esophagus was divided into 2 types: deep-seated esophagus or another type based on computed tomographic images in the supine position. In results, the deep-seated esophagus was associated with a longer operation time in the thorax and high incidence of severe morbidity of Clavien-Dindo classification ?IIIb, pneumonia, and any pulmonary morbidity.

27547595	2015	11	Visual Analysis of the Daily QA Results of Photon and Electron Beams of a Trilogy Linac over a Five-year Period.	['Data visualization technique was applied to analyze the daily QA results of photon and electron beams. Special attention was paid to any trend the beams might display. A Varian Trilogy Linac equipped with dual photon energies and five electron energies was commissioned in early 2010. Daily Linac QA tests including the output constancy, beam flatness and symmetry (radial and transverse directions) were performed with an ionization chamber array device (QA BeamChecker Plus, Standard Imaging). The data of five years were collected and analyzed. For each energy, the measured data were exported and processed for visual trending using an in-house Matlab program. These daily data were cross-correlated with the monthly QA and annual QA results, as well as the preventive maintenance records. Majority of the output were within 1% of variation, with a consistent positive/upward drift for all seven energies (~+0.25% per month). The baseline of daily device is reset annually right after the TG-51 calibration. This results in a sudden drop of the output. On the other hand, the large amount of data using the same baseline exhibits a sinusoidal behavior (cycle = 12 months; amplitude = 0.8%, 0.5% for photons, electrons, respectively) on symmetry and flatness when normalization of baselines is accounted for. The well known phenomenon of new Linac output drift was clearly displayed. This output drift was a result of the air leakage of the over-pressurized sealed monitor chambers for the specific vendor. Data visualization is a new trend in the era of big data in radiation oncology research. It allows the data to be displayed visually and therefore more intuitive. Based on the visual display from the past, the physicist might predict the trend of the Linac and take actions proactively. It also makes comparisons, alerts failures, and potentially identifies causalities.']	('Chan', 'Maria F')	International journal of medical physics, clinical engineering and radiation oncology	Int J Med Phys Clin Eng Radiat Oncol	['eng']

['A 42-year-old female with immunoglobulin A deficiency and recurrent sinopulmonary infections underwent thyroidectomy for papillary thyroid cancer (PTC). Follow-up (123)I scintigraphy demonstrated diffuse pulmonary uptake, suggesting metastatic disease. However, subsequent pathologic, biochemical and radiographic testing proved that she was in fact disease free, and the initial (123)I pulmonary uptake was identified as a false positive. Inflammatory conditions may rarely cause iodine uptake in non-thyroidal tissues due to local retention, organification, and/or immunologic utilization. To avoid exposing patients to unnecessary treatments, it is critical for clinicians to recognize that comorbid pulmonary conditions may mimic metastatic PTC on radioiodine scintigraphy.']	('Demidowich', 'Andrew Paul')	Nuclear medicine and molecular imaging	Nucl Med Mol Imaging	['eng']

27533936	2016	08	Recent advances in targeting the autotaxin-lysophosphatidate-lipid phosphate phosphatase axis in vivo.	['Extracellular lysophosphatidate (LPA) is a potent bioactive lipid that signals through six G-protein-coupled receptors. This signaling is required for embryogenesis, tissue repair and remodeling processes. LPA is produced from circulating lysophosphatidylcholine by autotaxin (ATX), and is degraded outside cells by a family of three enzymes called the lipid phosphate phosphatases (LPPs). In many pathological conditions, particularly in cancers, LPA concentrations are increased due to high ATX expression and low LPP activity. In cancers, LPA signaling drives tumor growth, angiogenesis, metastasis, resistance to chemotherapy and decreased efficacy of radiotherapy. Hence, targeting the ATX-LPA-LPP axis is an attractive strategy for introducing novel adjuvant therapeutic options. In this review, we will summarize current progress in targeting the ATX-LPA-LPP axis with inhibitors of autotaxin activity, LPA receptor antagonists, LPA monoclonal antibodies, and increasing low LPP expression. Some of these agents are already in clinical trials and have applications beyond cancer, including chronic inflammatory diseases.']	('Benesch', 'Matthew G K')	Journal of biomedical research	J Biomed Res	['eng']

"[""Significant changes in the shape, size and position of the bladder during radiotherapy (RT) treatment for bladder cancer have been correlated with high local failure rates; typically due to geographical misses. To account for this, large margins are added around the target volumes in conventional RT; however, this increases the volume of healthy tissue irradiation. The availability of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) has not only allowed in-room volumetric imaging of the bladder, but also the development of adaptive radiotherapy (ART) for modification of plans to patient-specific changes. The aim of this review is to: (1) identify and explain the different ART techniques being used in clinical practice and (2) compare and contrast these different ART techniques to conventional RT in terms of target coverage and dose to healthy tissue: A literature search was conducted using EMBASE, MEDLINE and Scopus with the key words 'bladder, adaptive, radiotherapy/radiation therapy'. 11 studies were obtained that compared different adaptive RT techniques to conventional RT in terms of target volume coverage and healthy tissue sparing. All studies showed superior target volume coverage and/or healthy tissue sparing in adaptive RT compared to conventional RT. Cross-study comparison between different adaptive techniques could not be made due to the difference in protocols used in different studies. However, one study found daily re-optimisation of plans to be superior to plan of the day technique. The use of adaptive RT for bladder cancer is promising. Further study is required to assess adaptive RT versus conventional RT in terms of local control and long-term toxicity.""]"	('Kibrom', 'Awet Z')	Journal of medical radiation sciences	J Med Radiat Sci	['eng']
27512573	2015	09	The provision of enteral nutritional support during definitive chemoradiotherapy in head and neck cancer patients.	['Combination chemoradiation is the gold standard of management for locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck. One of the most significant advantages of this approach to treatment is organ preservation which may not be possible with radical surgery. Unfortunately, few treatments are without side-effects and the toxicity associated with combined modality treatment causes meaningful morbidity. Patients with head and neck cancer (HNC) may have difficulties meeting their nutritional requirements as a consequence of tumour location or size or because of the acute toxicity associated with treatment. In particular, severe mucositis, xerostomia, dysgeusia and nausea and vomiting limit intake. In addition to this, dysphagia is often present at diagnosis, with many patients experiencing silent aspiration. As such, many patients will require enteral nutrition in order to complete chemoradiotherapy (CRT). Feeding occurs via catheters placed transnasally (nasogastric tubes) or directly into the stomach through the anterior abdominal wall (percutaneous gastrostomy tubes). In the absence of clear evidence concerning the superiority of one method over another, the choice of feeding tube tends to be dependent on clinician and patient preference. This review examines key issues associated with the provision of enteral nutritional support during definitive CRT in HNC patients, including feeding methods, patient outcomes and timing of tube insertion and use.']	('Bishop', 'Sarah')	Journal of medical radiation sciences	J Med Radiat Sci	['eng']

['Giving strong prognostic information, T-cell infiltration is on the verge of becoming an additional component in the routine clinical setting for classification of colorectal cancer (CRC). With a view to further improving the tools for prognostic evaluation, we have studied how Th1 lymphocyte infiltration correlates with prognosis not only by quantity, but also by subsite, within CRCs with different molecular characteristics (microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype status, and BRAF and KRAS mutational status). We evaluated the Th1 marker T-bet by immunohistochemistry in 418 archival tumour tissue samples from patients who underwent surgical resection for CRC. We found that a high number of infiltrating Th1 lymphocytes is strongly associated with an improved prognosis in patients with CRC, irrespective of intratumoural subsite, and that both extent of infiltration and patient outcome differ according to molecular subgroup. In brief, microsatellite instability, CpG island methylator phenotype-high and BRAF mutated tumours showed increased infiltration of Th1 lymphocytes, and the most pronounced prognostic effect of Th1 infiltration was found in these tumours. Interestingly, BRAF mutated tumours were found to be more highly infiltrated by Th1 lymphocytes than BRAF wild-type tumours whereas the opposite was seen for KRAS mutated tumours. These differences could be explained at least partly by our finding that BRAF mutated, in contrast to KRAS mutated, CRC cell lines and tumour specimens expressed higher levels of the Th1-attracting chemokine CXCL10, and reduced levels of CCL22 and TGFB1, stimulating Th2/Treg recruitment and polarisation. In conclusion, the strong prognostic importance of Th1 lymphocyte infiltration in CRC was found at all subsites evaluated, and it remained significant in multivariable analyses, indicating that T-bet may be a valuable marker in the clinical setting. Our results also indicate that T-bet is of value when analysed in molecular subgroups of CRC, allowing identification of patients with especially poor prognosis who are in need of extended treatment.']	('Ling', 'Agnes')	The journal of pathology.

Thirty-two cases were retrieved and histomorphology was reviewed. Clinical history and follow-up were obtained through electronic record review. DNA from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue was extracted and processed from 27 cases. Genome-wide DNA copy number (CN) alterations and allelic imbalances were analyzed by single nucleotide polymorphism array using Affymetrix OncoScan FFPE Assay. Massive high-throughput deep parallel sequencing was performed using a customized panel targeting 410 cancer genes. Log rank, Fisher's exact test and Cox proportional hazards were used for statistical analysis. In this series of 32 patients (male n\u2009=\u200912, female n\u2009=\u200920), the average age was 66 years (19-93) and median follow up was 24 months (range 6-120 months). Frequent genomic alterations included CN losses in tumour suppressor genes including CDKN2A (70%), TP53 (56%) and RB1 (49%). Mutations affecting methylation/demethylation, chromatin remodeling and WNT/SHH pathways were identified in 40%, 27%, and 27%, respectively. PIK3CA and TERT promoter variant mutations were identified in 11% of the cases. Cases harbouring simultaneous TP53 and RB1 biallelic CN losses were associated with worse overall survival and local recurrence (p\u2009=\u20090.04, p\u2009=\u20090.02, respectively). CDKN2A losses and positive margins were also associated with worse overall survival (p\u2009=\u20090.002; p\u2009=\u20090.03, respectively). Our findings suggest that age above 60, positive margin status, simultaneous biallelic TP53 and RB1 losses and CDKN2A loss are associated with a worse outcome in ESOSA.

Here we studied samples from 129 patients with primary SCC of the tongue for expression of podoplanin using immunohistochemistry. mRNA levels were analysed in another 27 cases of tongue SCC with adjacent clinically tumour-free tongue tissue and 14 tongue samples from healthy donors. Higher levels of podoplanin were seen in tumours compared to both normal tongue and clinically normal tongue in the tumour vicinity. No association was found between levels of podoplanin, presence of lymph node metastases or other clinical factors. Patients aged 40 or less were more likely to express high levels of podoplanin protein compared to older patients (p\u2009=\u20090.027). We conclude that levels of podoplanin in primary tongue SCCs are not associated with lymph node metastases. However, tongue SCCs arising in young patients (?40 years of age) are more likely to express high levels of podoplanin than tongue SCCs that arise in the more elderly. The data suggest that podoplanin has a distinctive role in young patients, who are known to have a poor prognosis: these patients may, therefore, benefit from podoplanin inhibitory therapies.']	('Sgaramella', 'Nicola')	The journal of pathology.

27499908	2015	09	HMGA2 expression distinguishes between different types of postpubertal testicular germ cell tumour.	['The group of postpubertal testicular germ cell tumours encompasses lesions with highly diverse differentiation - seminomas, embryonal carcinomas, yolk sac tumours, teratomas and choriocarcinomas. Heterogeneous differentiation is often present within individual tumours and the correct identification of the components is of clinical relevance. HMGA2 re-expression has been reported in many tumours, including testicular germ cell tumours. This is the first study investigating HMGA2 expression in a representative group of testicular germ cell tumours with the highly sensitive method of quantitative real-time PCR as well as with immunohistochemistry. The expression of HMGA2 and HPRT was measured using quantitative real-time PCR in 59 postpubertal testicular germ cell tumours. Thirty specimens contained only one type of tumour and 29 were mixed neoplasms. With the exception of choriocarcinomas, at least two pure specimens from each subgroup of testicular germ cell tumour were included. In order to validate the quantitative real-time PCR data and gather information about the localisation of the protein, additional immunohistochemical analysis with an antibody specific for HMGA2 was performed in 23 cases. Expression of HMGA2 in testicular germ cell tumours depended on the histological differentiation. Seminomas and embryonal carcinomas showed no or very little expression, whereas yolk sac tumours strongly expressed HMGA2 at the transcriptome as well as the protein level. In teratomas, the expression varied and in choriocarcinomas the expression was moderate. In part, these results contradict data from previous studies but HMGA2 seems to represent a novel marker to assist pathological subtyping of testicular germ cell tumours. The results indicate a critical role in yolk sac tumours and some forms of teratoma.']	('Kloth', 'Lars')	The journal of pathology. Clinical research	J Pathol Clin Res	['eng']
27499907	2015	07	Classical pathology and mutational load of breast cancer - integration of two worlds.	['Breast cancer is a complex molecular disease comprising several biological subtypes. However, daily routine diagnosis is still based on a small set of well-characterized clinico-pathological variables. Here, we try to link the two worlds of surgical pathology and multilayered molecular profiling by analyzing the relationships between clinico-pathological phenotypes and mutational loads of breast cancer. We evaluated the number of mutated genes with somatic non-silent mutations in different subgroups of breast cancer based on clinico-pathological, including immunohistochemical and tumour characteristics. The analysis was performed for a cohort of 687 primary breast cancer patients with mutational profiling, gene expression and clinico-pathological data available from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project. The number of mutated genes was strongly positively associated with higher tumour grade (p\u2009=\u20091.4e-14) and with the different immunohistochemical and PAM50 molecular subtypes of breast cancer (p\u2009=\u20091.4e-10 and p\u2009=\u20094.3e-10, respectively). We observed significant associations (|R|\u2009>\u20090.4) between the abundance of mutated genes and expression levels of genes related to proliferation in the overall cohort and hormone receptor positive cohort, including the Recurrence Score gene signature (e.g., MYBL2 and BIRC5). Specific mutated genes (TP53, NCOR1, NF1, PTPRD and RB1) were highly significantly associated with high loads of mutated genes. Multivariate analysis for overall survival (OS) revealed a worse survival for patients with high numbers of mutated genes (hazard ratio\u2009=\u20094.6, 95% CI: 1.0 - 20.0, p\u2009=\u20090.044). Here, we report a strong association of the number of mutated genes with immunohistochemical and PAM50 subtypes and tumour grade in breast cancer. We provide evidence that specific levels of the mutational load underlie different morphological and biological phenotypes, which collectively constitute the current basis of pathological diagnosis. Our study is a step towards genomics-informed breast pathology and will provide a basis for future studies in this field bridging the gap between morphology, tumour biology and medical oncology.']	('Budczies', 'Jan')	The journal of pathology.

['Sarcomatoid transformation, wherein an epithelioid carcinomatous tumour component coexists with a sarcomatoid histology, is a predictor of poor prognosis in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Our understanding of sarcomatoid change has been hindered by the lack of molecular examination. Thus, we sought to characterize molecularly the biphasic epithelioid and sarcomatoid components of sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma and compare them to non-sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma. We examined the transcriptome of the epithelioid and sarcomatoid components of advanced stage sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma (n=43) and non-sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma (n=37) from independent discovery and validation cohorts using the cDNA microarray and RNA-seq platforms. We analyzed DNA copy number profiles, generated using SNP arrays, from patients with sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma (n=10) and advanced non-sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma (n=155). The epithelioid and sarcomatoid components of sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma had similar gene expression and DNA copy number signatures that were, however, distinct from those of high-grade, high-stage non-sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Prognostic clear cell renal cell carcinoma gene expression profiles were shared by the biphasic components of sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma and the sarcomatoid component showed a partial epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition signature. Our genome-scale microarray-based transcript data were validated in an independent set of sarcomatoid and non-sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinomas using RNA-seq. Sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma is molecularly distinct from non-sarcomatoid clear cell renal cell carcinoma, with its genetic programming largely shared by its biphasic morphological components. These data explain why a low percentage of sarcomatoid histology augurs a poor prognosis; suggest the need to modify the pathological grading system and introduce the potential for candidate biomarkers to detect sarcomatoid change preoperatively without specifically sampling the histological sarcomatoid component.']	('Sircar', 'Kanishka')	The journal of pathology.

Here, we profiled 35 cervical carcinomas and 23 CIN grade 2/3 (CIN2/3) for mutations in 48 cancer-related genes using a Next Generation Sequencing-based cancer panel. PIK3CA exon 9 was the most frequently mutated locus in cervical carcinoma and the only mutated locus detected in CIN2/3. These PIK3CA exon 9 mutation findings were verified in a large, independent series (n\u2009=\u2009647) covering all stages of cervical carcinogenesis using high resolution melting-guided Sanger sequencing. PIK3CA exon 9 mutation frequency was 37.1% (13/35; 95%CI 21.2-54.0%) in cervical carcinoma, and 2.4% (5/209; 95%CI 0.5-4.7%) in CIN3. No PIK3CA exon 9 mutations were detected in CIN2 (0/144), CIN1 (0/154) and normal cervix (0/105). In a third series of 46 CIN2/3 lesions from women with a known 5-year history of preceding high-risk human papillomavirus (hrHPV) infection, detection of PIK3CA exon 9 mutation was confined to 2 (5.4%; 95%CI 0.0-13.2%) CIN3 lesions with preceding hrHPV infection ?5 years, and was absent in those with a short duration (<5 years) of preceding hrHPV infection. In conclusion, somatic mutation in PIK3CA represents a late event during cervical carcinogenesis, detected in a substantial subset of cervical carcinoma, but only in a minority of CIN3.']	('Verlaat', 'Wina')	The journal of pathology.

27499902	2015	04	In-depth molecular profiling of the biphasic components of uterine carcinosarcomas.	['Uterine carcinosarcoma is a clinically aggressive malignancy composed of a mix of carcinomatous and sarcomatous elements. We performed targeted next-generation sequencing of 27 uterine cancer and sarcoma genes together with immunohistochemical analyses of selected proteins in 30 uterine carcinosarcomas. This included 13 cases in which the distinct carcinoma and sarcoma components were sequenced separately and 10 cases where the metastatic tumours were analysed in addition to the primary tumours. We identified non-synonymous somatic mutations in 90% of the cases, with 27 of 30 cases (90%) harbouring TP53 alterations. The PI3K pathway was the most commonly mutated signalling pathway with mutations identified in PIK3CA, PTEN, PIK3R1, and/or PIK3R2 in two-thirds of the cases. Mutations in FBXW7, PPP2R1A, ARID1A and KRAS were demonstrated in a minority of cases. In cases where the carcinomatous and sarcomatous components were separately analysed, most of the mutations identified were present in both components, indicating a common origin for the two components. Furthermore, the same TP53 alterations and/or PI3K pathway mutations seen in the primary tumours were also identified in the metastatic sites. Overall, carcinosarcomas exhibited heterogeneous molecular features that resemble the heterogeneity seen in endometrial carcinomas, with some showing endometrioid carcinoma-like and others showing serous carcinoma-like mutation profiles. While patients with serous-like tumours presented more frequently with advanced-stage disease compared to patients with endometrioid-like tumours, there was no statistical difference in outcome between the two groups. Our results provide insights into the oncogenesis of uterine carcinosarcoma and identify targetable mutations that represent early oncogenic events. The findings of the different molecular types of uterine carcinosarcoma that parallel the different molecular types in endometrial carcinoma may have future treatment implications with targeted therapies.']	('McConechy', 'Melissa K')	The journal of pathology.

27499901	2015	04	A 12-gene signature to distinguish colon cancer patients with better clinical outcome following treatment with 5-fluorouracil or FOLFIRI.	['Currently, there is no marker in use in the clinical management of colon cancer to predict which patients will respond efficiently to 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), a common component of all cytotoxic therapies. Our aim was to develop and validate a multigene signature associated with clinical outcome from 5-FU therapy and to determine if it could be used to identify patients who might respond better to alternate treatments. Using a panel of 5-FU resistant and sensitive colon cancer cell lines, we identified 103 differentially expressed genes providing us with a 5-FU response signature. We refined this signature using a clinically relevant DNA microarray-based dataset of 359 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colon cancer samples. We then validated the final signature in an external independent DNA microarray-based dataset of 316 stage III FFPE samples from the PETACC-3 (Pan-European Trails in Alimentary Tract Cancers) clinical trial. Finally, using a drug sensitivity database of 658 cell lines, we generated a list of drugs that could sensitize 5-FU resistant patients using our signature. We confirmed using the PETACC-3 dataset that the overall survival of subjects responding well to 5-FU did not improve with the addition of irinotecan (FOLFIRI; two-sided log-rank test p = 0.795). Conversely, patients who responded poorly to 5-FU based on our 12-gene signature were associated with better survival on FOLFIRI therapy (one-sided log-rank test p = 0.039). This new multigene signature is readily applicable to FFPE samples and provides a new tool to help manage treatment in stage III colon cancer. It also provides the first evidence that a subgroup of colon cancer patients can respond better to FOLFIRI than 5-FU treatment alone.']	('Paquet', 'Eric R')	The journal of pathology.

Although myxoid liposarcoma is relatively chemosensitive and thus a good candidate for chemotherapy, cases with relapsed or metastatic disease still have poor outcome. Here, we performed a gene microarray analysis to compare the gene expression profiles in six clinical myxoid liposarcoma samples and three normal adipose tissue samples, and to identify molecular biomarkers that would be useful as diagnostic markers or treatment targets in myxoid liposarcoma. This showed that the cancer-testis antigen PRAME was up-regulated in myxoid liposarcoma. We then performed immunohistochemical, western blotting and real-time polymerase chain reaction analyses to quantify the expression of PRAME and another cancer-testis antigen, NY-ESO-1, in clinical samples of myxoid liposarcoma (n\u2009=\u200993), dedifferentiated (n\u2009=\u200946), well-differentiated (n\u2009=\u200932) and pleomorphic liposarcomas (n\u2009=\u200914). Immunohistochemically, positivity for PRAME and NY-ESO-1 was observed in 84/93 (90%) and 83/93 (89%) of the myxoid liposarcomas, and in 20/46 (43%) and 3/46 (7%) of the dedifferentiated, 3/32 (9%) and 1/32 (3%) of the well-differentiated and 7/14 (50%) and 3/21 (21%) of the pleomorphic liposarcomas, respectively. High immunohistochemical expression of PRAME and/or NY-ESO-1 was significantly correlated with tumour diameter, the existence of tumour necrosis, a round-cell component of >5%, higher histological grade and advanced clinical stage. High PRAME and NY-ESO-1 expression correlated significantly with poor prognosis in a univariate analysis. The myxoid liposarcomas showed significantly higher protein and mRNA expression levels of PRAME and NY-ESO-1 (CTAG1B) than the other liposarcomas. In conclusion, PRAME and NY-ESO-1 (CTAG1B) were expressed in the vast majority of myxoid liposarcomas, and their high-level expression correlated with tumour grade and poor prognosis. Our results support the potential use of PRAME and NY-ESO-1 as ancillary parameters for differential diagnosis and as prognostic biomarkers, and indicate that the development of immunotherapy against these cancer-testis antigens in myxoid liposarcoma would be warranted.']	('Iura', 'Kunio')	The journal of pathology.

['EGFR mutation testing is now well established as a means of selecting the optimal first-line therapy for patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, deciding on the correct treatment for EGFR wild-type NSCLC remains a challenge. EGFR fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) testing of gene copy number has been a promising marker, but has provided mixed results despite attempts to standardize the reading and scoring process. The novel ReadMax reading and scoring system focuses on the most aberrant cells, to identify oncogene addiction, rather than taking a representative reading as in the Colorado method. The methodology was developed using historical samples from the TRUST and MERIT studies, followed by re-reading of the samples from the SATURN trial. Analysis of samples using the ReadMax methodology revealed that progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were improved in patients with ReadMax FISH-positive (RM FISH+) tumours, compared with those whose tumours were not RM FISH+: PFS hazard ratios (HRs) were 0.52 for RM FISH+ versus 0.93 for not RM FISH+; OS HRs were 0.69 and 0.92, respectively. For PFS, HR for RM FISH+ versus not RM FISH+ in the SATURN erlotinib group was 0.53 (p\u2009=\u20090.003). The PFS and OS results were also similar in the EGFR wild-type population (PFS HRs were 0.63 and 0.96; OS HRs were 0.61 and 0.84, respectively), although amplification of the EGFR gene in patients with EGFR wild-type disease was not found to be predictive of treatment outcomes, which was unexpected but not unprecedented. KRAS status was not found to affect outcomes. Further experience is required to refine the ReadMax methodology and fully establish its validity and robustness. In conclusion, the ReadMax scoring system to identify patients with EGFR FISH-positive NSCLC is a promising technique, which could improve treatment options and outcomes for patients with advanced NSCLC, in particular for EGFR wild-type tumours.']	('Moecks', 'Joachim')	The journal of pathology.

27499876	2016	11	Genome-wide analysis reveals conserved transcriptional responses downstream of resting potential change in Xenopus embryos, axolotl regeneration, and human mesenchymal cell differentiation.	['Endogenous bioelectric signaling via changes in cellular resting potential (V mem) is a key regulator of patterning during regeneration and embryogenesis in numerous model systems. Depolarization of V mem has been functionally implicated in dedifferentiation, tumorigenesis, anatomical re-specification, and appendage regeneration. However, no unbiased analyses have been performed to understand genome-wide transcriptional responses to V mem change in vivo. Moreover, it is unknown which genes or gene networks represent conserved targets of bioelectrical signaling across different patterning contexts and species. Here, we use microarray analysis to comparatively analyze transcriptional responses to V mem depolarization. We compare the response of the transcriptome during embryogenesis (Xenopus development), regeneration (axolotl regeneration), and stem cell differentiation (human mesenchymal stem cells in culture) to identify common networks across model species that are associated with depolarization. Both subnetwork enrichment and PANTHER analyses identified a number of key genetic modules as targets of V mem change, and also revealed important (well-conserved) commonalities in bioelectric signal transduction, despite highly diverse experimental contexts and species. Depolarization regulates specific transcriptional networks across all three germ layers (ectoderm, mesoderm, and endoderm) such as cell differentiation and apoptosis, and this information will be used for developing mechanistic models of bioelectric regulation of patterning. Moreover, our analysis reveals that V mem change regulates transcripts related to important disease pathways such as cancer and neurodegeneration, which may represent novel targets for emerging electroceutical therapies.']	('Pai', 'Vaibhav P')	Regeneration (Oxford, England)	Regeneration (Oxf)	['eng']

['The epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) has been established as an important target of HER2-positive lung cancer, but somatic mutations in HER2 kinase domain are frequently observed that may cause drug resistance and sensitivity for tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). In this study, the response profile of 14 small-molecule TKIs upon 11 clinical HER2 mutations was investigated systematically using a synthetic strategy that integrated in silico analysis and in vitro assay to explore the structural basis, energetic property and biological implication underlying the intermolecular interactions of TKIs with wild-type and variant HER2. It is found that most clinical mutations are far away from HER2 active site and thus can only address modest or moderate effect on inhibitor binding. However, few single-point substations such as D769H and D769Y as well as the gatekeeper mutation T798\u2005M were predicted to cause strong resistance for an array of TKIs by reshaping the geometric feature and physiochemical property of the active site.

['An atypical protein kinase C, PKMzeta has become an attractive target for various neurological disorders including long term potentiation, cognition, neuropathic pain and cancer. Drug discovery efforts have been hindered due to the non-availability of the protein structure and hence in the present study we attempted to build the open and closed models of the protein PKMzeta using homology modeling. The models were then used to identify PKMzeta inhibitors utilizing a high-throughput virtual screening protocol from a large commercial chemical database. Compounds were selected based on the binding interactions and Glide score. Compounds were then subjected to in vitro luminescent based kinase assay for their inhibitory activity on targeted protein. Seven compounds exhibited IC50 s less than or equal to 10\u2005µM. Cell based assays revealed that Lead C3 and Lead C6 exhibited selectivity towards methylmercury treated neuroblastoma growth inhibition and suppressed reactive oxygen species with IC50 s of 0.89 and 0.17\u2005µM, respectively. Furthermore, Lead C3 exhibited attenuation of proinflammatory response with least energy in dynamic simulation studies and thus emerged as a prototypical lead for further development as novel inhibitor of PKMzeta for neurological implications.']	('Purkayastha', 'Priyanka')	Molecular informatics	Mol Inform	['eng']

['The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling pathway regulates many important cellular functions. The functional impact of deregulating the PIK3CA gene, encoding the p110? catalytic subunit of PI3K, is validated by frequent gain of function mutations in a range of human cancers. We generated a mouse model with an inducible constitutively active form of PI3K. In this model Cre recombinase activates expression of a myristoylated form of p110? (myr-p110?). The myristoylated version of p110? brings the protein to the cytoplasmic side of the cell membrane, which mimics the normal activation mechanism for the p110? catalytic subunit and activates the PI3K enzyme. Constitutively activated PI3K signaling induced by myr-p110? in all cells of the developing mouse caused lethality during embryonic development. Transgenic Cre;myr-p110? heterozygous embryos displayed morphological malformation and poor vascular development with extremely dilated blood vessels and hemorrhage in the embryo and the extraembryonic yolk sac. Previous studies demonstrated that loss of p110? during embryonic development causes angiogenic disruption and here we show that constitutive activation of p110? by gain of function mutation during development also disrupts vasculogenesis/angiogenesis in what appears to be a similar manner. These finding demonstrate the importance of tight regulation of PI3K signaling during embryonic vasculogenesis/angiogenesis..']	('Sheen', 'Mee Rie')	Open life sciences	Open Life Sci	['eng']

['Toll-like receptor (TLR) 4 agonists have emerged as a new group of molecules used for cancer therapy. They have been exploited to enhance the immunogenicity of current chemotherapeutic regimens. However, their effects on cancer cells remain elusive. Here, we showed that a TLR4 agonist, namely a synthetic lipid A analog (ALA), OM-174, exhibits antitumor effects in several mammary tumor mouse models. We also showed that immune components are involved in such effects, as attested to by the failure of ALA to induce tumor regression or an increase of animal survival in mice knocked-out for interferon ?

TLR4 and IFN? receptor (INFR2) expressed by cancer cells are involved in the antitumor efficacy of ALA since this last did not inhibit tumor growth in mice bearing a tumor but lacking TLR4 or IFN? receptor 2 (IFNR2). Mechanistic investigations revealed that nitric oxide (NO), superoxide and peroxynitrite produced by uncoupling of inducible NO synthase (NOS II) in cancer cells are key mediators of ALA and IFN?-mediated tumor growth inhibition.

27467922	2016	12	Combined inhibition of TGF? and PDGF signaling attenuates radiation-induced pulmonary fibrosis.	['Background : Radiotherapy (RT) is a mainstay for the treatment of lung cancer, but the effective dose is often limited by the development of radiation-induced pneumonitis and pulmonary fibrosis. Transforming growth factor ? (TGF?) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) play crucial roles in the development of these diseases, but the effects of dual growth factor inhibition on pulmonary fibrosis development remain unclear. Methods : C57BL/6 mice were treated with 20\xa0Gy to the thorax to induce pulmonary fibrosis. PDGF receptor inhibitors SU9518 and SU14816 (imatinib) and TGF? receptor inhibitor galunisertib were applied individually or in combinations after RT. Lung density and septal fibrosis were measured by high-resolution CT and MRI. Lung histology and gene expression analyses were performed and Osteopontin levels were studied. Results : Treatment with SU9518, SU14816 or galunisertib individually attenuated radiation-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis and decreased radiological and histological signs of lung damage. Combining PDGF and TGF? inhibitors showed to be feasible and safe in a mouse model, and dual inhibition significantly attenuated radiation-induced lung damage and extended mouse survival compared to blockage of either pathway alone. Gene expression analysis of irradiated lung tissue showed upregulation of PDGF and TGF?-dependent signaling components by thoracic irradiation, and upregulation patterns show crosstalk between downstream mediators of the PDGF and TGF? pathways. Conclusion : Combined small-molecule inhibition of PDGF and TGF? signaling is a safe and effective treatment for radiation-induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis in mice and may offer a novel approach for treatment of fibrotic lung diseases in humans. Translational statement : RT is an effective treatment modality for cancer with limitations due to acute and chronic toxicities, where TGF? and PDGF play a key role. Here, we show that a combined inhibition of TGF? and PDGF signaling is more effective in attenuating radiation-induced lung damage compared to blocking either pathway alone. We used the TGF?-receptor I inhibitor galunisertib, an effective anticancer compound in preclinical models and the PDGFR inhibitors imatinib and SU9518, a sunitinib analog. Our signaling data suggest that the reduction of TGF? and PDGF signaling and the attenuation of SPP1 (Osteopontin) expression may be responsible for the observed benefits. With the clinical availability of similar compounds currently in phase-I/II trials as cancer therapeutics or already approved for certain cancers or idiopathic lung fibrosis (IPF), our study suggests that the combined application of small molecule inhibitors of TGF? and PDGF signaling may offer a promising approach to treat radiation-associated toxicity in RT of lung cancer.']	('Dadrich', 'Monika')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDA) is a very aggressive tumor for which effective therapeutical strategies are still lacking. Globally, the 5 y survival rate is 5-7% and surgery is the only potentially curative treatment. Immunotherapy represents a novel possibility for treating PDA, and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), which are increased in cancer patients and correlate with metastatic burden and cancer stage, offer a new target in cancer therapy. We have previously shown that antibodies against the PDA-associated antigen ?-enolase (ENO1) are detected in more than 60% of PDA patients and correlate with a better prognosis. Furthermore, ENO1-DNA vaccination in mice induced anti-ENO1 antibodies that mediated antitumor activity. In this study, the effects of anti-ENO1 binding on MDSC functions and on the T cell response were evaluated. Here, we show that MDSC express ENO1 on their surface, which increased after LPS stimulation. Moreover, anti-ENO1 mAb inhibited adhesion to endothelial cells, as well as in vitro and in vivo migration. Similarly, after ENO1 mAb treatment of MDSC, arginase activity decreased, while the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (particularly IL-6) increased, and co-stimulatory molecule expression and suppression functions were only partially affected. Finally, we found that activated T cells in the presence of anti-ENO1 mAb-treated MDSC increased IFN? and IL-17 secretion and decreased IL-10 and TGF? secretion compared to control MDSC. In conclusion, anti-ENO1 antibodies may inhibit in vivo the infiltration into the tumor microenvironment of MDSC, and attenuate their restraining of effector T cell response, opening a new perspective to render PDA immunotherapy more effective.']	('Cappello', 'Paola')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Remarkable efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibition has been reported for several types of solid tumors and early studies in gastric adenocarcinoma are promising. A detailed knowledge about the natural biology of immune checkpoints in gastric adenocarcinoma is essential for clinical and translational evaluation of these drugs. This study is a comprehensive analysis of cytotoxic T lymphocyte associated molecule 4 (CTLA-4) and programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression in gastric adenocarcinoma. PD-L1 and CTLA-4 were stained on tumor sections of 127 Caucasian patients with gastric adenocarcinoma by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and somatic mutation profiling was performed using targeted next-generation sequencing. Expression of PD-L1 and CTLA-4 on lymphocytes in tumor sections, tumor-draining lymph nodes (TDLN) and peripheral blood were studied by flow-cytometry and immune-fluorescence microscopy in an additional cohort. PD-L1 and CTLA-4 were expressed in 44.9% (57/127) and 86.6% (110/127) of the analyzed gastric adenocarcinoma samples, respectively. Positive tumor cell staining for PD-L1 or CTLA-4 was associated with inferior overall survival. Somatic mutational analysis did not reveal a correlation to expression of PD-L1 or CTLA-4 on tumor cells. Expression of PD-1 (52.2%), PD-L1 (42.2%) and CTLA-4 (1.6%) on tumor infiltrating T cells was significantly elevated compared to peripheral blood. Of note, PD-1 and PD-L1 were expressed far higher by tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes than CTLA-4. In conclusion, specific immune checkpoint-inhibitors should be evaluated in this disease and the combination with molecular targeted therapies might be of benefit. An extensive immune monitoring should accompany these studies to better understand their mode of action in the tumor microenvironment.']	('Schlößer', 'Hans A')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27467910	2016	07	HLA ligandomics identifies histone deacetylase 1 as target for ovarian cancer immunotherapy.	['The recent approval of clincially effective immune checkpoint inhibitors illustrates the potential of cancer immunotherapy. A challenging task remains the identification of specific targets guiding immunotherapy. Facilitated by technical advances, the direct identification of physiologically relevant targets is enabled by analyzing the HLA ligandome of cancer cells. Since recent publications demonstrate the immunogenicity of ovarian cancer (OvCa), immunotherapies, including peptide-based cancer vaccines, represent a promising treatment approach. To identify vaccine peptides, we employed a combined strategy of HLA ligandomics in high-grade serous OvCa samples and immunogenicity analysis. Only few proteins were naturally presented as HLA ligands on all samples analyzed, including histone deacetylase (HDAC) 1 and 2. In vitro priming of CD8(+) T cells demonstrated that two HDAC1/2-derived HLA ligands can induce T-cell responses, capable of killing HLA-matched tumor cells. High HDAC1 expression shown by immunohistochemistry in 136 high-grade serous OvCa patients associated with significantly reduced overall survival (OS), whereas patients with high numbers of CD3(+) tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) in the tumor epithelium and CD8(+) TILs in the tumor stroma showed improved OS. However, correlating HDAC1 expression with TILs, high levels of TILs abrogated the impact of HDAC1 on OS. This study strengthens the role of HDAC1/2 as an important tumor antigen in OvCa, demonstrating its impact on OS in a large cohort of OvCa patients. We further identified two immunogenic HDAC1-derived peptides, which frequently induce multi-functional T-cell responses in many donors, suitable for future multi-peptide vaccine trials in OvCa patients.']	('Peper', 'Janet Kerstin')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

A collection of novel psammaplin A analogs focused on the variations of substituents at the benzene ring and modifications at the oxime moiety were synthesized. Among all the synthesized compounds, 5d and 5e showed better HDAC inhibition than psammaplin A and comparable cytotoxicity against four cancer cell lines (PC-3, MCF-7, A549 and HL-60).

27441231	2015	12	Adjustment of lifetime risks of space radiation-induced cancer by the healthy worker effect and cancer misclassification.	"['Background. The healthy worker effect (HWE) is a source of bias in occupational studies of mortality among workers caused by use of comparative disease rates based on public data, which include mortality of unhealthy members of the public who are screened out of the workplace. For the US astronaut corp, the HWE is assumed to be strong due to the rigorous medical selection and surveillance. This investigation focused on the effect of correcting for HWE on projected lifetime risk estimates for radiation-induced cancer mortality and incidence. Methods. We performed radiation-induced cancer risk assessment using Poisson regression of cancer mortality and incidence rates among Hiroshima and Nagasaki atomic bomb survivors. Regression coefficients were used for generating risk coefficients for the excess absolute, transfer, and excess relative models. Excess lifetime risks (ELR) for radiation exposure and baseline lifetime risks (BLR) were adjusted for the HWE using standardized mortality ratios (SMR) for aviators and nuclear workers who were occupationally exposed to ionizing radiation. We also adjusted lifetime risks by cancer mortality misclassification among atomic bomb survivors. Results. For all cancers combined (""Nonleukemia""), the effect of adjusting the all-cause hazard rate by the simulated quantiles of the all-cause SMR resulted in a mean difference (not percent difference) in ELR of 0.65% and mean difference of 4% for mortality BLR, and mean change of 6.2% in BLR for incidence. The effect of adjusting the excess (radiation-induced) cancer rate or baseline cancer hazard rate by simulated quantiles of cancer-specific SMRs resulted in a mean difference of [Formula: see text] in the all-cancer mortality ELR and mean difference of [Formula: see text] in the mortality BLR. Whereas for incidence, the effect of adjusting by cancer-specific SMRs resulted in a mean change of [Formula: see text] for the all-cancer BLR. Only cancer mortality risks were adjusted by simulated quantiles for misclassification, and results indicate a mean change of 1.1% for all-cancer mortality ELR, while the mean change in the all-cancer PC was approximately 4% for males and 6% for females. Conclusions. The typical life table approach for projecting lifetime risk of radiation-induced cancer mortality and incidence for astronauts and radiation workers can be improved by adjusting for HWE while simulating the uncertainty of input rates, input excess risk coefficients, and bias correction factors during multiple Monte Carlo realizations of the life table.']"	('Peterson', 'Leif E')	Heliyon	Heliyon	['eng']

['The rapid development of fluorescence imaging technologies requires concurrent improvements in the performance of fluorescent probes. Quantum dots have been extensively used as an imaging probe in various research areas because of their inherent advantages based on unique optical and electronic properties. However, their clinical translation has been limited by the potential toxicity especially from cadmium. Here, a versatile bioimaging probe is developed by using highly luminescent cadmium-free CuInSe2/ZnS core/shell quantum dots conjugated with CGKRK (Cys-Gly-Lys-Arg-Lys) tumor-targeting peptides. This probe exhibits excellent photostability, reasonably long circulation time, minimal toxicity, and strong tumor-specific homing property. The most important feature of this probe is that it shows distinctive versatility in tumor-targeted multimodal imaging including near-infrared, time-gated, and two-photon imaging in different tumor models. In a glioblastoma mouse model, the targeted probe clearly denotes tumor boundaries and positively labels a population of diffusely infiltrating tumor cells, suggesting its utility in precise tumor detection during surgery. This work lays a foundation for potential clinical translation of the probe.']	('Liu', 'Xiangyou')	Advanced functional materials	Adv Funct Mater	['eng']
27439749	2016	11	H2AX phosphorylation level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells as an event-free survival predictor for bladder cancer.	['Bladder cancer (BC) has a typical aetiology characterized by a multistep carcinogenesis due to environmental exposures, genetic susceptibility, and their interaction. Several lines of evidence suggest that DNA repair plays a role in the development and progression of BC. In particular, the study of individual susceptibility to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) may provide valuable information on BC risk, and help to identify those patients at high-risk of either recurrence or progression of the disease, possibly personalizing both surveillance and treatment. Among the different DSB markers, the most well characterized is phosphorylation of the histone H2AX (?-H2AX). We assessed any potential role of ?-H2AX as a molecular biomarker in a case-control study (146 cases and 146 controls) to identify individuals with increased BC risk and at high-risk of disease recurrence or progression. We investigated ?-H2AX levels in peripheral blood mononuclear cells before and after their exposure to ionizing radiation (IR). We did not find any significant difference among cases and controls. However, we observed a significant association between ?-H2AX basal levels and risk of disease recurrence or progression. In particular, both BC patients as a whole and the subgroup of non-muscle invasive BC (NMIBC) with high basal H2AX phosphorylation levels had a decreased risk of recurrence or progression (for all BC HR 0.70, 95%CI 0.52-0.94, P\u2009=\u20090.02; for NMIBC HR 0.68, 95%CI 0.50-0.92, P\u2009=\u20090.01), suggesting a protective effect of basal DSB signaling. Our data suggest that ?-H2AX can be considered as a potential molecular biomarker to identify patients with a higher risk of BC recurrence. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']	('Turinetto', 'Valentina')	Molecular carcinogenesis	Mol.

Thus development of novel anti-CD20 mAbs with great cell killing ability and enhance CD20 levels on cell surface can potentially exploit lymphoma therapy. In this scenario, we are summarizing the recently developed mAbs against CD20 and compounds that have ability to induce CD20 expression at significant level. We also are providing information regarding combination strategy for use of radiation and anti-CD20 mAbs in vitro. However, it will need to be determined by rigorous at pre-clinical and clinic testing. We hope this review will be beneficial for current research in the area of immunotherapy or radio-immunotherapy.']	('Singh', 'Vijay')	Journal of cancer science & therapy	J Cancer Sci Ther	['eng']

As women delay the start of their family, the co-existence of cancer and pregnancy is increasingly observed. Nevertheless, lung cancer during pregnancy remains a rather uncommon condition with less than 70 cases published in recent years. Non-small cell lung carcinoma is the commonest type accounting for about 85% of all cases. Overall survival rates are low. Chemotherapy and/or targeted treatment have been used with poor outcomes. The disease has been also found to affect the products of conception with no short- or long-term consequences for the neonate.

['Diagnosis of midline neck swellings may give a myriad of options, ranging from ranula, thyroglossal duct cyst, cystic hygroma, cystic lymphangioma, epidermoid, dermoid and teratoid cysts to benign or malignant neoplasms of the mucosa or salivary glands and also rare skin appendage tumours like pilomatricoma or pilomatrix carcinoma. Various pitfalls are encountered in diagnosing these midline swellings as most of the features are overlapping. Careful history and examination have to be complemented with other diagnostic aids such as conventional radiography, ultrasonography, aspiration cytology and computed tomography to arrive at a correct diagnosis. Dermoid cysts in the head and neck are relatively uncommon, present in the midline either above or below the mylohyoid muscle thus differentiating it into sublingual and submental dermoids and can grow to a massive size before presenting symptoms if it breaches the mylohyoid muscle. Pilomatricoma is a skin appendage tumour which presents as midline swelling and is usually diagnosed with careful history and certain pathagnomonic features on fine needle aspiration cytology and ultrasonography. Hereby we are presenting a case of a submental swelling which was diagnosed as a dermoid cyst upon excision but which initially posed a diagnostic challenge because of features of pilomatricoma seen on FNAC.']	('Sheshadri', 'P')	Journal of maxillofacial and oral surgery	J Maxillofac Oral Surg	['eng']

Both, solitary as well as extramedullary bone plasmacytomas may, particularly in later stages, be accompanied by other osteolytic bone lesions (multifocal bone involvement) and features such as anemia, hypercalcemia, or renal impairment attributable to and indicative of progression to multiple myeloma. These three distinct disorders together comprise the plasma cell neoplasms and essentially represent a continuum of related disease processes. Extramedullary and solitary bone plasmacytomas of the head and neck region are extremely uncommon, and amongst them plasmacytoma of the maxilla is extremely rare. Such a case is being reported here for its rarity. Also, it was associated with multifocal skeletal involvement, making a correct categorization difficult as well as imperative in order to institute the correct treatment. Radiotherapy is considered to be the treatment of choice of plasmacytoma, with adjuvant chemotherapy for multi focal involvement. Surgery is usually limited to biopsy and excision of any residual disease following radiotherapy.

['In the past few decades, advances in imaging equipment and protocols have expanded the role of imaging in in vivo diagnosis and disease management, especially in cancer. Traditional imaging agents have rapid clearance and low specificity for disease detection. To improve accuracy in disease identification, localization and assessment, novel nanomaterials are frequently explored as imaging agents to achieve high detection specificity and sensitivity. A promising material for this purpose are hydrogel nanoparticles, whose high hydrophilicity, biocompatibility, and tunable size in the nanometer range make them ideal for imaging. These nanogels (10 to 200 nm) can circumvent uptake by the reticuloendothelial system, allowing longer circulation times than small molecules. In addition, their size/surface properties can be further tailored to optimize their pharmacokinetics for imaging of a particular disease.

"[""Apolipoprotein A-I (apo A-I) an indispensable component and a major structural protein of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), plays a vital role in reverse cholesterol transport and cellular cholesterol homeostasis since its identification. Its multifunctional role in immunity, inflammation, apoptosis, viral, bacterial infection etc. has crossed its boundary of its potential of protecting cardiovascular system and lowering cardiovascular disease risk, attributing HDL to be known as a protective fat removal particle. Its structural homology with prostacyclin stabilization factor has contributed to its anti-clotting and anti-aggregatory effect on platelet which has potentiated its cardio-protective role as well as its therapeutic efficacy against Alzheimer's disease. The binding affinity and neutralising action against endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, reduces the toxic manifestations of septic shock. As a negative acute phase protein, it blocks T-cell signalling of macrophages. However the recently identified anti-tumor activity of apo A-I has been highlighted in various models of melanoma, lung cancer, ovarian cancer, lymphoblastic leukaemia, gastric as well as pancreatic cancers. These cancer fighting effects are directed towards regression of tumor size and distant metastasis by its immuno modulatory activity as well as its clearing effect on serum lysophospholipids. This lowering effect on lysophospholipid concentration is utilized by apo A-I mimetic peptides to be used in retarding tumor cell proliferation and as a potential cancer therapeutic agent. Not only that, it inhibits the tumor associated neo-angiogenesis as well as brings down the matrix degrading enzymes associated with tumor metastasis. However this efficient therapeutic potential of apo A-I as an anti tumor agent awaits further future experimental studies in humans.""]"	('Mangaraj', 'Manaswini')	Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB	Indian J Clin Biochem	['eng']

['X-ray mammography, the current gold standard for breast cancer detection, has a 20% false-negative rate (cancer is undetected) and increases in younger women with denser breast tissue. Diffuse optical imaging (DOI) is a safe (nonionizing), and relatively inexpensive method for noninvasive imaging of breast cancer in human subjects (including dense breast tissues) by providing physiological information (e.g. oxy- and deoxy- hemoglobin concentration). At the Optical Imaging Laboratory, a hand-held optical imager has been developed which employs a breast contourable probe head to perform simultaneous illumination and detection of large surfaces towards near real-time imaging of human breast cancer. Gen-1 and gen-2 versions of the handheld optical imager have been developed and previously demonstrated imaging in tissue phantoms and healthy human subjects. Herein, the hand-held optical imagers are applied towards in vivo imaging of breast cancer subjects in an attempt to determine the ability of the imager to detect breast tumors. Five female human subjects (ages 51-74) diagnosed with breast cancer were imaged with the gen-1 optical imager prior to surgical intervention. One of the subjects was also imaged with the gen-2 optical imager. Both imagers use 785 nm laser diode sources and ICCD camera detectors to generate 2D surfaces maps of total hemoglobin absorption. The subjects lay in supine position and images were collected at various locations on both the ipsilateral (tumor-containing) and contralateral (non-tumor containing) breasts. The optical images (2D surface maps of optical absorption due to total hemoglobin concentration) show regions of higher intensity at the tumor location, which is indicative of increased vasculature and higher blood content due to the presence of the tumor. Additionally, a preliminary result indicates the potential to image lymphatic spread. This study demonstrates the potential of the hand-held optical devices to noninvasively image breast cancer in human subjects.']	('Erickson-Bhatt', 'Sarah J')	Biomedical physics & engineering express	Biomed Phys Eng Express	['eng']

However, attention to palliative support and non-cancer co-morbidities has been limited. This study identified types of care for and co-morbidities of persons dying of breast cancer compared to persons dying from all cancers and from non-cancer causes. Methods: Linked administrative data from population-based registries were used to examine 121,458 deaths in Nova Scotia from 1995 to 2009. Results: Breast cancer decedents' mean age was similar to that of all cancer decedents (72.0 versus 72.1 years), but their age spread was greater (20-59 years: 23.1% versus 16.7%; 90+ years: 11.2% versus 6.5%). Among women dying of breast cancer, 15.6% were enrolled in the diabetes registry and 15.1% in the cardiovascular registry, indicating that they had these non-cancer conditions prior to their death. Compared to all cancer decedents, breast cancer decedents were twice as likely to have dementia as a cause of death, and were less likely to die in hospital but more likely to die in a nursing home. Breast cancer decedents had place of death rates more similar to non-cancer than cancer decedents. Conclusions: Rates of dementia and diabetes among the breast cancer decedents were particularly note-worthy in this novel study given that these comorbidities have not received much attention in the breast cancer research literature.

['The goal of this review was to compare long-term oncologic outcomes of robotic versus laparoscopic resection of colorectal cancer. A literature search was performed using PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane, and Medline (2002-2014). Search terms: laparoscopic, robotic, rectal, colon, surgery, oncologic, and outcomes. Studies comparing overall and disease free survival of robotic versus laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer were included. Meta-analysis was performed using OpenMeta[Analyst] for Windows 8. Five studies were identified reporting on overall survival, disease free survival, lymph node extraction, and distal and circumferential resection margin. Three hundred and seventeen patients underwent robotic resection and 368 underwent laparoscopic resection, with similar demographics. Operative times were longer with robotic resections, with no difference in estimated blood loss (EBL) or length of stay. The disease stage was distributed similarly in both groups. Similar numbers underwent neo-adjuvant therapy. Laparoscopic resection was associated with 3.2\xa0mm larger distal resection margins (p\u2009=\u20090.04) and 2.2 more lymph nodes removed (p\u2009=\u20090.001), but with equivalent circumferential resection margin status. Disease-free and overall survival was equivalent. Robotic and laparoscopic surgery for colorectal cancer offer comparable overall and disease free survival. Laparoscopic surgery offered a slight advantage in operative time, distal margin, and lymph node yield. Larger, prospective trials are needed to confirm the equivalence of these approaches.']	('Wilder', 'Fatima G')	The Indian journal of surgery	Indian J Surg	['eng']

['Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is endemic in southern China, and its incidence in Hong Kong is relatively high. Radiotherapy is the mainstay treatment for NPC due to its relatively high radiosensitivity and deep-seated anatomical position, which is not readily accessible by surgery. Although the technique of radiotherapy in NPC has been advancing and offers promising treatment outcome, complications around the irradiation areas are inevitable and the quality of life of the post-radiotherapy patients is often compromised. Trismus, which is defined as the restricted mouth opening or jaw movement due to the disorder of temporo-mandibular joint (TMJ), is one of the possible late complications for radiotherapy of NPC and is found in 5-17% of the post-radiotherapy (post-RT) patients. Trismus at early stage may only affect the speech, but in severe cases nutritional intake and oral hygiene condition may deteriorate seriously. This article reviewed the possible causes of radiation-induced TMJ damage, the various assessments including imaging modalities and possible treatments. The conclusion is that the availability of simple, yet effective examinations for trismus is essential for delaying the progression and restoring TMJ functions. Although there is no absolutely effective treatment for trismus, many supportive, restorative and palliative management are possible under different clinical situations.']	('Wu', 'Vincent W C')	Journal of medical radiation sciences	J Med Radiat Sci	['eng']

['A proportion of MYC translocation positive diffuse large B-cell lymphomas (DLBCL) harbour a BCL2 and/or BCL6 translocation, known as double-hit DLBCL, and are clinically aggressive. It is unknown whether there are other genetic abnormalities that cooperate with MYC translocation and form double-hit DLBCL, and whether there is a difference in clinical outcome between the double-hit DLBCL and those with an isolated MYC translocation. We investigated TP53 gene mutations along with BCL2 and BCL6 translocations in a total of 234 cases of DLBCL, including 81 with MYC translocation. TP53 mutations were investigated by PCR and sequencing, while BCL2 and BCL6 translocation was studied by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization. The majority of MYC translocation positive DLBCLs (60/81\u2009=\u200974%) had at least one additional genetic hit. In MYC translocation positive DLBCL treated by R-CHOP (n\u2009=\u200967), TP53 mutation and BCL2, but not BCL6 translocation had an adverse effect on patient overall survival. In comparison with DLBCL with an isolated MYC translocation, cases with MYC/TP53 double-hits had the worst overall survival, followed by those with MYC/BCL2 double-hits. In MYC translocation negative DLBCL treated by R-CHOP (n\u2009=\u2009101), TP53 mutation, BCL2 and BCL6 translocation had no impact on patient survival. The prognosis of MYC translocation positive DLBCL critically depends on the second hit, with TP53 mutations and BCL2 translocation contributing to an adverse prognosis. It is pivotal to investigate both TP53 mutations and BCL2 translocations in MYC translocation positive DLBCL, and to distinguish double-hit DLBCLs from those with an isolated MYC translocation.']	('Clipson', 'Alexandra')	The journal of pathology.

['Lung cancer is associated with very poor prognosis and considered one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Here, we present highly potent and selective bio-hybrid RNAi-peptide nanoparticles that can induce specific and long-lasting gene therapy in inflammatory tumour associated macrophages (TAMs), via an immune modulation of the tumour milieu combined with tumour suppressor effects. Our data prove that passive gene silencing can be achieved in cancer cells using regular RNAi NPs. When combined with M2 peptide-based targeted immunotherapy that immuno-modulates TAMs cell-population, a synergistic effect and long-lived tumour eradication can be observed along with increased mice survival. Treatment with low doses of siRNA (ED50 0.0025-0.01 mg/kg) in a multi and long-term dosing system substantially reduced the recruitment of inflammatory TAMs in lung tumour tissue, reduced tumour size (?95%) and increased animal survival (?75%) in mice. Our results suggest that it is likely that the combination of silencing important genes in tumour cells and in their supporting immune cells in the tumour microenvironment, such as TAMs, will greatly improve cancer clinical outcomes.']	('Conde', 'João')	Advanced functional materials	Adv Funct Mater	['eng']
27335534	2015	09	Cyborgs in the Everyday: Masculinity and Biosensing Prostate Cancer.	"[""An in vivo biosensor is a technology in development that will assess the biological activity of cancers to individualise external beam radiotherapy. Inserting such technology into the human body creates cybernetic organisms; a cyborg that is a human-machine hybrid. There is a gap in knowledge relating to patient willingness to allow automated technology to be embedded and to become cyborg. There is little agreement around what makes a cyborg and less understanding of the variation in the cyborgisation process. Understanding the viewpoint of possible beneficiaries addresses such gaps. There are currently three versions of 'cyborg' in the literature (i) a critical feminist STS concept to destabilise power inherent in dualisms, (ii) an extreme version of the human/machine in science-fiction that emphasises the 'man' in human and (iii) a prediction of internal physiological adaptation required for future space exploration. Interview study findings with 12 men in remission from prostate cancer show a fourth version can be used to describe current and future sub-groups of the population; 'everyday cyborgs'. For the everyday cyborg the masculine cyborg status found in the fictionalised human-machine related to issues of control of the cancer. This was preferred to the felt stigmatisation of being a 'leaker and bleeder'. The willingness to become cyborg was matched with a having to get used to the everyday cyborg's technological adaptations and risks. It is crucial to explore the everyday cyborg's sometimes ambivalent viewpoint. The everyday cyborg thus adds the dimension of participant voice currently missing in existing cyborg literatures and imaginations.""]"	('Haddow', 'Gill')	Science as culture	Sci Cult (Lond)	['eng']

Elevated levels of MDM2 due to overexpression or gene amplification can contribute to tumor development by suppressing p53 activity. Since MDM2 is an oncogene, we explored the possibility that other genetic lesions, namely missense mutations, might alter its activities. We selected mutations in MDM2 that reside in one of the 4 key regions of the protein: p53 binding domain, acidic domain, zinc finger domain, and the RING domain. Unexpectedly, we observed that individual mutations in several of these domains compromised the ability of MDM2 to degrade p53. Mutations in the N-terminal p53 binding domain prevented the formation of a p53-MDM2 complex, thereby protecting p53 from degradation. Additionally, as would be predicted, several cancer-associated mutations in the RING finger domain disrupted the ubiquitin ligase activity of MDM2 and prevented p53 degradation. Interestingly, we observed that amino acid substitutions at the same codon differentially affected MDM2 activity. Our data reveal that mutations in this oncogene can have the paradoxical effect of suppressing its activity. Further understanding of how these mutations perturb MDM2 function may yield novel approaches to inhibiting its activity.']	('Chauhan', 'Krishna M')	Molecular & cellular oncology	Mol Cell Oncol	['eng']

27308597	2016	07	Regulation of the centrosome cycle.	['The centrosome, consisting of mother and daughter centrioles surrounded by the pericentriolar matrix (PCM), functions primarily as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) in most animal cells. In dividing cells the centrosome duplicates once per cell cycle and its number and structure are highly regulated during each cell cycle to organize an effective bipolar spindle in the mitotic phase. Defects in the regulation of centrosome duplication lead to a variety of human diseases, including cancer, through abnormal cell division and inappropriate chromosome segregation. At the end of mitosis the daughter centriole disengages from the mother centriole. This centriole disengagement is an important licensing step for centrosome duplication. In S phase, one new daughter centriole forms perpendicular to each centriole. The centrosome recruits further PCM proteins in the late G2 phase and the two centrosomes separate at mitotic entry to form a bipolar spindle. Here, we summarize research findings in the field of centrosome biology, focusing on the mechanisms of regulation of the centrosome cycle in human cells.']	('Fujita', 'Hiroki')	Molecular & cellular oncology	Mol Cell Oncol	['eng']

As in any dynamic system, identifying how cells communicate to maintain homeostasis and how this communication is altered during oncogenesis are key hurdles for developing therapies to restore normal tissue homeostasis. Here, I discuss tissues as dynamic systems, using the mammary gland as an example, and the evolutionary concepts applied to oncogenesis. Drawing from these concepts, I present 2 competing hypotheses for how intercellular communication might be altered during oncogenesis. As an initial test of these competing hypotheses, a recent secretome comparison between normal human mammary and HER2+ breast cancer cell lines suggested that the particular proteins secreted by the malignant cells reflect a convergent evolutionary path associated with oncogenesis in a specific anatomical niche, despite arising in different individuals.

Cancer incidence and mortality rates for some cancers in the USA and European countries have steadily decreased over the last decades, whereas the incidence and mortality of certain cancers in China have been increasing at an alarming speed. Rapid industrialization and urbanization in China have been accompanied by incredible changes in lifestyle and environment combined with an aging population. Mortality caused by lung, colorectal and breast cancers has been steadily increasing, whereas cancer mortality from gastric, esophageal and cervical tumors has tended to decrease. Similar to what has occurred in the United States, unhealthy lifestyles in China, including heavy smoking and poor diet combined with pollution, have contributed to increased cancer risk. China is facing many challenges in cancer treatment and prevention for the general population. The major areas that need to be addressed in the control of cancer in China include cancers associated with environmental pollution, tobacco use, occupational carcinogens, infection, excessive alcohol consumption, dietary deficiencies and obesity. In this perspective, we review the problems in each area and suggest ideas for future directions in cancer research and strategies and actions to reduce the incidence of cancer in China.']	('Bode', 'Ann M')	National science review	Natl Sci Rev	['eng']

The result indicates no significant changes on cell viability.

It up-regulates anti-apoptotic gene bcl-2 mRNA expression. In addition, Ki 67 and PCNA mRNA, and protein expressions were determined. Taking all these together, we conclude that aspartame may be a potent substance to slow-down the apoptosis process in HeLa cells.

['The present investigation examined the interactive effects of rumination and negative affectivity in relation to anxiety and depressive symptoms and psychopathology among 245 Latino adults (M age\xa0=\xa039.7, SD\xa0=\xa011.4; 86.9\xa0% female; 97.6\xa0% reported Spanish as their first language) attending a community-based primary healthcare clinic. As expected, there was a significant interaction between rumination and negative affectivity for depressive, suicidal, social anxiety, anxious arousal symptoms, number of mood and anxiety disorders, and disability among the primary care Latino sample. Inspection of the interaction forms indicated a high degree of conceptual similarity. Specifically, rumination was related to greater levels of suicidal symptoms, social anxiety, anxious arousal, number of mood and anxiety disorders, and disability among individuals with higher, but not lower, levels of negative affectivity. The form of the interaction for depressive symptoms was in line with this pattern, but more extreme; rumination was related to greater levels of depressive symptoms among individuals with both higher and lower levels of negative affectivity. Together, these data provide novel empirical evidence suggesting that there is clinically relevant interplay between rumination and negative affectivity in regard to a relatively wide array of anxiety and depressive variables among Latinos in a primary care medical setting.']	('Zvolensky', 'Michael J')	Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities	J Racial Ethn Health Disparities	['eng']

['We estimated and compared the sex- and age-adjusted prevalence of chronic diseases (diagnosis only and comorbidity) among US- and foreign-born whites from Europe and the Arab Nations and examined associations between region of birth and chronic disease. We evaluated 213,644 adults using restricted data from the National Health Interview Survey (2000-2011) by (1) chronic disease diagnosis only (heart disease, asthma, cancer, diabetes, ulcer, or obesity) and (2) comorbidity (none, diagnosis only, comorbid). We used logistic regression to examine associations between region of birth and chronic disease while controlling for confounders. Foreign-born whites from the Arab Nations had a higher prevalence of being diagnosed with ulcer (4\xa0%) compared to US- and European-born whites (2\xa0%). Foreign-born whites from the Arab Nations had a lower prevalence of comorbid cancer (1\xa0%) and ulcer (3\xa0%) yet had higher estimates of comorbid heart disease (18\xa0%), asthma (5\xa0%), and obesity (13\xa0%) when compared to European-born whites (all ps\xa0<\xa00.05). Arab Americans had the highest prevalence of comorbid diabetes (8\xa0%) compared to both European- (5\xa0%) and US-born whites (6\xa0%). In multivariate logistic regression models, Arab Americans had a lower odds of reporting cancer, heart disease, and asthma before and after controlling for covariates. Our study builds on existing literature for Arab Americans as the first study evaluating chronic disease prevalence among foreign-born whites from countries in the Arab League of Nations geographically located in the Middle East. Methodologically robust studies are needed to better understand the influence of acculturation, country of origin, and other characteristics influencing health among foreign-born whites.']	('Dallo', 'Florence J')	Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities	J Racial Ethn Health Disparities	['eng']

27294747	2016	10	First Year Open Enrollment Findings: Health Insurance Coverage for Asian Americans and the Role of Navigators.	['The health insurance coverage established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act has created an opportunity to reduce racial/ethnic disparities in healthcare. It is expected that of the 24 million individuals projected to join, nearly one-half will be non-white and one-fourth will speak a language other than English at home. Asian Americans are one of the fastest growing racial/ethnic groups in the USA. The majority are foreign born and experience limited English proficiency. The role of navigators has been shown to increase enrollment rates of public insurance programs. They are trusted for their shared traditions and sense of community. By conducting culturally-targeted outreach, Cambodian, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and Laotian community-based organizations were able to reach individuals for whom the percentage of uninsured is disproportionately high. They enrolled eligible Asians immigrants in coverage despite language barriers and limited health knowledge. Through a collaborative network, a community-level intervention was implemented that was associated with increases in first year marketplace enrollment and greater likelihood of obtaining a primary care physician. Preventable illnesses, lost productivity, and inadequate healthcare are major hardships in immigrant communities that bear similar burdens to society.

The purpose of this study was to quantify the potential sex- and race/ethnicity-specific gains in life expectancy had we been able to fully or partially eliminate the leading causes of death in Los Angeles County. Complete annual life tables for local residents were generated by applying the same method used for the National Center of Health Statistics US life tables published in 1999. Based on 2010 Los Angeles County mortality records, sex- and race/ethnicity-specific potential gains in life expectancy were calculated using scenarios of 10, 20, 50, and 100\xa0% elimination of 12 major causes of death. Coronary heart disease, the leading cause of death, was found to be most impactful on life expectancy. Its hypothetical full elimination would result in life expectancy gains ranging from 2.2\xa0years among white females to 3.7\xa0years among black males. Gains from complete elimination of lung cancer and stroke ranked second, with almost an additional year of life for each gender. However, marked disparities across racial/ethnic groups were noted from the elimination of several other causes of death, such as homicide, from which the gain among black males exceeded 13 times more than their white counterparts. By differentially targeting specific causes of death in disease prevention, not only can findings of this study aid in efficiently narrowing racial/ethnic disparities, they can also provide a quantitative means to identify and rank priorities in local health policymaking.']	('Ho', 'Alex')	Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities	J Racial Ethn Health Disparities	['eng']

The immobilization or delivery of growth factors has been explored to improve vascularization capacity of tissue engineered constructs, however, the use of growth factors has inherent problems such as the loss of signaling capability and the risk of complications such as immunological responses and cancer. Here, a new method of preparing water-insoluble silk protein scaffolds with vascularization capacity using an all aqueous process is reported. Acid was added temporally to tune the self-assembly of silk in lyophilization process, resulting in water insoluble scaffold formation directly. These biomaterials are mainly noncrystalline, offering improved cell proliferation than previously reported silk materials. These systems also have appropriate softer mechanical property that could provide physical cues to promote cell differentiation into endothelial cells, and enhance neovascularization and tissue ingrowth in vivo without the addition of growth factors. Therefore, silk-based degradable scaffolds represent an exciting biomaterial option, with vascularization capacity for soft tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.']	('Han', 'Hongyan')	Advanced functional materials	Adv Funct Mater	['eng']

['Aflatoxins (AFT) are poisonous substances which are classified in Group 1 carcinogenic agents to humans by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). AFT can occur naturally in food commodities (maize, corn, rice) as a result of fungal contamination in hot and humid environments. In the food, toxin contamination can remain during manufacturing and long after fungi have stopped being biologically active. Aflatoxin B1 (AFB1) is the most dominant and potent agent from all AFT. In developing countries, high exposure to AFB1 can cause chronic toxicity and usually increases the incidence of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC). However, in these regions hepatitis B is the most common risk factor for HCC cases. Many researches were aimed to enlighten the mechanism and the role of two etiological agents on risk of HCC, but the obtained data was conflicting with each other. It was uncertain that the indicators/biomarkers might be the contribution of the carcinogenic status of the patient; and, the biomarker samples from the subject may only reflect the recent effects of the toxin exposure after consumption of AFB1 contaminated commodities. The studies were facing with the errors of methods which were un-fit to enlighten the possible interaction between Hepatitis B and AFB1 on contribution to HCC. It was pivotal to understand the effect of each risk factor in order to prevent and improve public health in poor and undeveloped regions. Although some of the studies evaluate AFB1 alone as a considerable factor on HCC risk, according to this review it was concluded vice versa. This study was aimed to clarify the main etiological agent of HCC where AFB1 and HBV are endangering public health. In additionally, the purpose was to enlighten the possible synergistic effect between these two factors among HCC pathogenesis. Hence forth, appropriate and right applications could be conducted in undeveloped countries in order to protect public health.']	('Kucukcakan', 'Basak')	Open access Macedonian journal of medical sciences	Open Access Maced J Med Sci	['eng']

27274863	2015	07	Fast range measurement of spot scanning proton beams using a volumetric liquid scintillator detector.	['Accurate confirmation and verification of the range of spot scanning proton beams is crucial for correct dose delivery. Current methods to measure proton beam range using ionization chambers are either time-consuming or result in measurements with poor spatial resolution. The large-volume liquid scintillator detector allows real-time measurements of the entire dose profile of a spot scanning proton beam. Thus, liquid scintillator detectors are an ideal tool for measuring the proton beam range for commissioning and quality assurance. However, optical artefacts may decrease the accuracy of measuring the proton beam range within the scintillator tank. The purpose of the current study was to 1) develop a geometric calibration system to accurately calculate physical distances within the liquid scintillator detector, taking into account optical artefacts; and 2) assess the accuracy, consistency, and robustness of proton beam range measurement using the liquid scintillator detector with our geometric calibration system. The range of the proton beam was measured with the calibrated liquid scintillator system and was compared to the nominal range. Measurements were made on three different days to evaluate the setup robustness from day to day, and three sets of measurements were made for each day to evaluate the consistency from delivery to delivery. All proton beam ranges measured using the liquid scintillator system were within half a millimeter of the nominal range. The delivery-to-delivery standard deviation of the range measurement was 0.04 mm, and the day-to-day standard deviation was 0.10 mm. In addition to the accuracy and robustness demonstrated by these results when our geometric calibration system was used, the liquid scintillator system allowed the range of all 94 proton beams to be measured in just two deliveries, making the liquid scintillator detector a perfect tool for range measurement of spot scanning proton beams.']	('Hui', 'CheukKai')	Biomedical physics & engineering express	Biomed Phys Eng Express	['eng']

['Ursolic acid (UA), a well-known natural triterpenoid found in abundance in blueberries, cranberries and apple peels, has been reported to possess many beneficial health effects. These effects include anticancer activity in various cancers, such as skin cancer. Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the world. Nuclear factor E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is a master regulator of antioxidative stress response with anticarcinogenic activity against UV- and chemical-induced tumor formation in the skin. Recent studies show that epigenetic modifications of Nrf2 play an important role in cancer prevention. However, the epigenetic impact of UA on Nrf2 signaling remains poorly understood in skin cancer. In this study, we investigated the epigenetic effects of UA on mouse epidermal JB6 P+ cells. UA inhibited cellular transformation by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate at a concentration at which the cytotoxicity was no more than 25%. Under this condition, UA induced the expression of the Nrf2-mediated detoxifying/antioxidant enzymes heme oxygenase-1, NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase 1 and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1A1. DNA methylation analysis revealed that UA demethylated the first 15 CpG sites of the Nrf2 promoter region, which correlated with the reexpression of Nrf2. Furthermore, UA reduced the expression of epigenetic modifying enzymes, including the DNA methyltransferases DNMT1 and DNMT3a and the histone deacetylases (HDACs) HDAC1, HDAC2, HDAC3 and HDAC8 (Class I) and HDAC6 and HDAC7 (Class II), and HDAC activity.

To fill this gap, we investigated the linguistic markers of change in cognitive and emotional processing among women with breast cancer, highlighting the differences and peculiarities during different treatment phases. A total of 60 writings were collected from 20 women: 10 receiving chemotherapy and 10 receiving biological therapy. We performed a series of repeated measures ANOVA for the most meaningful LIWC linguistic categories, including positive/negative emotions and cognitive processes, to assess change over three sessions. Results demonstrated a significant increase in the positive emotions category for the entire group of women, with particular relevance for the biological therapy group of women, and a marginally significant (p = .07) greater use of words indicating cognitive processes for women receiving biological therapy. For the negative emotions category time was significant for the whole group of women, showing a peak of use in the second session of writing. Peculiar differences in the linguistic markers of processing trauma were observed between the two groups. Although the writing intervention is a support for both groups of women, it seems to be beneficial when there is a large time gap since the administration of chemotherapy and, thus, when the patient can revisit the experience.

The second purpose was to set up a discussion of the genetic paradigm of diffuse infiltrating retinoblastoma. It has often been described to occur sporadically; however, in the last years, it has been shown that it might be heritable. A literature search concerning diffuse infiltrating retinoblastoma considering English, German and Spanish cases and case series identified 77 patients.

27239081	2016	07	Difficulties with Emotion Regulation and Psychopathology Interact to Predict Early Smoking Cessation Lapse.	['There is little knowledge about how emotion regulation difficulties interplay with psychopathology in terms of smoking cessation. Participants (n = 250; 53.2 % female, Mage = 39.5, SD = 13.85) were community-recruited daily smokers (?8 cigarettes per day) who self-reported motivation to quit smoking; 38.8 % of the sample met criteria for a current (past 12-month) psychological disorder. Emotion regulation deficits were assessed pre-quit using the Difficulties with Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS; Gratz and Roemer in J Psychopathol Behav Assess 26(1):41-54, 2004) and smoking behavior in the 28 days post-quit was assessed using the Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB; Sobell and Sobell in Measuring alcohol consumption: psychosocial and biochemical methods. Humana Press, Totowa, 1992). A Cox proportional-hazard regression analysis was used to model the effects of past-year psychopathology, DERS (total score), and their interaction, in terms of time to lapse post-quit day. After adjusting for the effects of gender, age, pre-quit level of nicotine dependence, and treatment condition, the model revealed a non-significant effect of past-year psychopathology (OR = 1.14, CI95 % = 0.82-1.61) and difficulties with emotion regulation (OR = 1.01, CI95 % = 1.00-1.01) on likelihood of lapse rate. However, the interactive effect of psychopathology status and difficulties with emotion regulation was significant (OR = 0.98, CI95 % = 0.97-0.99). Specifically, there was a significant conditional effect of psychopathology status on lapse rate likelihood at low, but not high, levels of emotion regulation difficulties. Plots of the cumulative survival functions indicated that for smokers without a past-year psychological disorder, those with lower DERS scores relative to elevated DERS scores had significantly lower likelihood of early smoking lapse, whereas for smokers with past-year psychopathology, DERS scores did not differentially impact lapse rate likelihood. Smokers with emotion regulation difficulties may have challenges quitting, and not having such difficulties, especially without psychopathology, decreases the potential likelihood of early lapse.']	('Farris', 'Samantha G')	Cognitive therapy and research	Cognit Ther Res	['eng']
27239073	2015	04	Modelling the type and timing of consecutive events: application to predicting preterm birth in repeated pregnancies.	"[""Predicting the occurrence and timing of adverse pregnancy events such as preterm birth is an important analytical challenge in obstetrical practice. Developing statistical approaches that can be used to assess the risk and timing of these adverse events will provide clinicians with tools for individualized risk assessment that account for a woman's prior pregnancy history. Often adverse pregnancy outcomes are subject to competing events; for example, interest may focus on the occurrence of pre-eclampsia-related preterm birth, where preterm birth for other reasons may serve as a competing event. We propose modelling the type and timing of adverse outcomes in repeated pregnancies. We formulate a joint model, where types of adverse outcomes across repeated pregnancies are modelled by using a polychotomous logistic regression model with random effects, and gestational ages at delivery are modelled conditionally on the types of adverse outcome. The correlation between gestational ages conditional on the adverse pregnancies is modelled by the semiparametric normal copula function. We present a two-stage estimation method and develop the asymptotic theory for the estimators proposed. The model and estimation procedure proposed are applied to the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development consecutive pregnancies study data and evaluated by simulations.""]"	('Shih', 'Joanna H')	Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

Both gall stones and gall bladder cancer are common in North India. All tertiary care centres in India report high rates of gall bladder cancer (GBC) incidence and poor treatment outcomes in the majority of cases due to advanced stage of presentation. Csendes of Chile has reported very high incidence of gallbladder cancer in Chile and Bolivia and advocated prophylactic cholecystectomy in asymptomatic patients. Incidence rate of gall bladder cancer in Indian males is equal to that of Chile, whereas in females, the rates are almost double the rates of Chile. Indians have also been found to have high concentrations of heavy metals in gall bladder wall, and antibodies to tumor suppressor genes. In India, gall bladder cancer is the commonest GI cancer in women and fourth commonest cancer overall in the female population.

['Colonoscopy represents a very important diagnostic modality for screening for colorectal cancer, because it has the ability to both detect and effectively remove pro-malignant and malignant lesions. It is recommended by almost all international and national gastroenterology and cancer societies, as an initial screening modality or, following a positive fecal occult blood test, to be performed every 10\xa0years in individuals of average risk starting from the age of 50. However, a significant problem is the so-called post-screening (interval) polyps and cancers found some years after the index colonoscopy. In order to reduce the rate of interval cancers it is extremely necessary to optimize the quality and effectiveness of colonoscopy. Bowel preparation is of paramount importance for both accurate diagnosis and subsequent treatment of lesions found on colonoscopy. The quality of bowel preparation could be significantly improved by splitting the dose regimens, a strategy that has been shown to be superior to single-dose regimen. A good endoscopic technique and optimal withdrawal time offering adequate time for inspection, would further optimize the rate of cecal intubation and the number of lesions detected. During the last years, sophisticated devices have been introduced that would further facilitate cecal intubation. The percentage of total colonoscopies is now super-passing the level of 95\xa0% allowing the adenoma detection rate to be greater than the suggestive level of 25\xa0% in men and 15\xa0% in women.

There is reluctance in accepting preoperative chemoradiation primarily due to fear of increased perioperative morbidity/mortality or non-availability of infrastructure and expertise. We present a retrospective analysis of our results of radical esophagectomy after neoadjuvant chemoradiation. All patients who underwent Radical Esophagectomy from January 2009 to December 2013 by a single surgical team at our institute were included in the series (n\u2009=\u2009118). Patients undergoing surgery after chemo-radiation (group A\u2009=\u200966) were compared with those under going upfront surgery (group B\u2009=\u200952) in terms of patient variables (age, sex, comorbidities, tumor location, staging, histology) and postoperative surgical outcomes and complications using Chi square test. Overall and disease free survival was analyzed using Kaplan Meir curve. There was no difference in duration of surgery, postoperative stay and overall morbidity and mortality in both groups. Although group A patients had more of advanced cases clinically, but histopathology showed complete pathological response (pCR) in nearly 40\xa0% patients and negative nodes (pN0) in 62.5\xa0% patients. OS and DFS showed a trend towards better survival with preoperative chemoradiation.

The objective of this study was to determine the prognostic value of baseline CEA and surgical resection of the primary among patients with synchronous stage IV CRC in the era of modern chemotherapy and biologic therapy. The Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results Registry was searched to identify patients with synchronous stage IV CRC diagnosed between 2004 and 2009. Colorectal-cancer-specific survival (CCS) was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier product limit method. Cox models were fitted to assess the multivariable relationship of various patient and tumor characteristics and CCS. Three hundred thirty-three thousand, three hundred ninety nine patients were identified in the SEER registry. Median CCS among patients with their primary tumor removed was 21\xa0M vs. 7\xa0M (primary intact) respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.001). Median CCS among patients who had an elevated vs. non-elevated baseline CEA level was 14\xa0M vs. 24\xa0M respectively (p\u2009<\u20090.0001). By multivariable analysis, patients with an elevated baseline CEA had a 56\xa0% increased risk of death from CRC compared to those with a non-elevated CEA level (HR\u2009=\u20091.56, 95%CI 1.47-1.65, p\u2009<\u20090.0001).

['Lipid coated calcium phosphate (LCP) nanoparticles (NPs) remain an attractive option for siRNA systemic delivery. Previous research has shown that the stoichiometry of reactants affects the size and morphology of nanostructured calcium phosphate (CaP) particles. However, it is unclear how synthesis parameters such as the Ca/P molar ratio and mixing style influence the siRNA loading and protection by LCP NPs, and subsequent siRNA delivery efficiency. In this research, we found that the Ca/P molar ratio is critical in controlling the size, zeta potential, dispersion state, siRNA loading and protection. Based on the siRNA loading efficiency and capacity as well as siRNA protection effectiveness, we suggested an optimized LCP NPs delivery system. The optimized LCP NPs had a hollow, spherical structure with the average particle size of ~40 nm and were able to maintain their stability in serum containing media and PBS for over 24 h, with a pH-sensitive dissolution property. The superior ability of optimized LCP NPs to maintain the integrity of encapsulated siRNA and the colloidal stability in culture medium allow this formulation to achieve improved cellular accumulation of siRNA and enhanced growth inhibition of human breast cancer cells in vitro, compared with the commercial transfection agent Oligofectamine.']	('Tang', 'Jie')	Journal of materials chemistry.

The compounds are more stable in physiological media than those previously reported and are highly cytotoxic against human cancer renal cell lines. We describe here preliminary mechanistic data involving studies on the interaction of selected compounds with plasmid (pBR322) DNA used as a model nucleic acid, and with selected protein kinases from a panel of 35 protein kinases having oncological interest. Preliminary mechanistic studies in Caki-1 renal cells indicate that the cytotoxic and anti-migration effects of the most active compound 5 ([(?-C5H5)2TiMe(?-mba)Au(PPh3)] involve inhibition of thioredoxin reductase and loss of expression of protein kinases that drive cell migration (AKT, p90-RSK, and MAPKAPK3). The co-localization of both titanium and gold metals (1:1 ratio) in Caki-1 renal cells was demonstrated for 5 indicating the robustness of the heterometallic compound in vitro. Two compounds were selected for further in vivo studies on mice based on their selectivity in vitro against renal cancer cell lines when compared to non-tumorigenic human kidney cell lines (HEK-293T and RPTC) and the favourable preliminary toxicity profile in C57BL/6 mice. Evaluation of Caki-1 xenografts in NOD.CB17-Prkdc SCID/J mice showed an impressive tumor reduction (67%) after treatment for 28 days (3 mg/kg/every other day) with heterometallic compound 5 as compared with the previously described [(?-C5H5)2Ti{OC(O)-4-C6H4-P(Ph2)AuCI}2] 3 which was non-inhibitory.

['Studies demonstrate that regular physical activity and, more recently, limited sedentary behavior are associated with reduced risk of colorectal neoplasia. However, the biological mechanisms of action for physical activity versus sedentary behavior are not clear. Epigenetic variation is suggested as a potential mechanism that would allow for independent, or possibly even synergistic, effects of activity and inactivity on colorectal epithelium. We describe the evidence for epigenetic variation as a link between physical activity and sedentary behavior in colorectal neoplasia risk. There are few studies that directly evaluate this relationship. However, the growing literature describes a variety of gene targets influenced by activity that are also important to colorectal neoplasia etiology. Future studies may identify epigenetic markers with translational significance in identifying high-risk individuals or those for whom a personalized activity regimen could significantly alter the methylation signature in colon epithelial cells, and thus future risk of colorectal cancer.']	('Hibler', 'Elizabeth')	Current colorectal cancer reports	Curr Colorectal Cancer Rep	['eng']

Because of the different underlying mechanisms of neoplasia, these familial tumors may have different characteristics compared with their sporadic counterparts. Large-scale clinical trials are frequently lacking due to the rarity of these diseases. With technological advances and the development of new medications, the natural history, diagnosis, and management of these syndromes are also evolving. In this article, we summarize the recent knowledge on endocrine neoplasms in three familial hyperparathyroidism syndromes, with an emphasis on disease characteristics, molecular pathogenesis, recent developments in biochemical and radiological evaluation, and expert opinions on surgical and medical therapies. Because these familial hyperparathyroidism syndromes are associated with a wide variety of tumors in different organs, this review is focused on those endocrine neoplasms with malignant potential.']	('Li', 'Yulong')	Endocrine-related cancer	Endocr.

27200367	2015	12	Pan-cancer analyses of the nuclear receptor superfamily.	['Nuclear receptors (NR) act as an integrated conduit for environmental and hormonal signals to govern genomic responses, which relate to cell fate decisions. We review how their integrated actions with each other, shared co-factors and other transcription factors are disrupted in cancer. Steroid hormone nuclear receptors are oncogenic drivers in breast and prostate cancer and blockade of signaling is a major therapeutic goal. By contrast to blockade of receptors, in other cancers enhanced receptor function is attractive, as illustrated initially with targeting of retinoic acid receptors in leukemia. In the post-genomic era large consortia, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas, have developed a remarkable volume of genomic data with which to examine multiple aspects of nuclear receptor status in a pan-cancer manner. Therefore to extend the review of NR function we have also undertaken bioinformatics analyses of NR expression in over 3000 tumors, spread across six different tumor types (bladder, breast, colon, head and neck, liver and prostate). Specifically, to ask how the NR expression was distorted (altered expression, mutation and CNV) we have applied bootstrapping approaches to simulate data for comparison, and also compared these NR findings to 12 other transcription factor families. Nuclear receptors were uniquely and uniformly downregulated across all six tumor types, more than predicted by chance. These approaches also revealed that each tumor type had a specific NR expression profile but these were most similar between breast and prostate cancer. Some NRs were down-regulated in at least five tumor types (e.g. NR3C2/MR and NR5A2/LRH-1)) whereas others were uniquely down-regulated in one tumor (e.g. NR1B3/RARG). The downregulation was not driven by copy number variation or mutation and epigenetic mechanisms maybe responsible for the altered nuclear receptor expression.']	('Long', 'Mark D')	Nuclear receptor research	Nucl Receptor Res	['eng']

We retrieved the inferior vena cava filter and placed a nephrostomy catheter to relieve the ureteral obstruction. Our case highlights the importance of careful inferior vena cava manipulation during abdominal surgery in the presence of an inferior vena cava filter, and the option of temporary removal of the filter to be placed again after surgery in order to avoid this complication, unless protection is required against clot migration during the surgical procedure.""]"	('Abdel-Aal', 'Ahmed Kamel')	Journal of radiology case reports	J Radiol Case Rep	['eng']

"[""Epidemiological miner cohort data used to estimate lung cancer risks related to occupational radon exposure often lack cohort-wide information on exposure to tobacco smoke, a potential confounder and important effect modifier. We have developed a method to project data on smoking habits from a case-control study onto an entire cohort by means of a Monte Carlo resampling technique. As a proof of principle, this method is tested on a subcohort of 35,084 former uranium miners employed at the WISMUT company (Germany), with 461 lung cancer deaths in the follow-up period 1955-1998. After applying the proposed imputation technique, a biologically-based carcinogenesis model is employed to analyze the cohort's lung cancer mortality data. A sensitivity analysis based on a set of 200 independent projections with subsequent model analyses yields narrow distributions of the free model parameters, indicating that parameter values are relatively stable and independent of individual projections. This technique thus offers a possibility to account for unknown smoking habits, enabling us to unravel risks related to radon, to smoking, and to the combination of both.""]"	('van Dillen', 'Teun')	Risk analysis : an official publication of the Society for Risk Analysis	Risk Anal.

['T cell infiltration at the tumor site has been identified as a major predictor for the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy. The chemokine C-C motif ligand 22 (CCL22) is highly expressed by immune cells in murine and human pancreatic cancer. Expression of its corresponding receptor, C-C chemokine receptor type 4 (CCR4), is restricted to regulatory T cells (Treg). We show that transduction of cytotoxic T cells (CTL) with CCR4 enhances their immigration into a pancreatic cancer model. Further, we show that binding of CCR4 with CCL22 strengthens the binding of T cell LFA-1 to dendritic cell (DC) ICAM-1 and increases CTL activation. In vivo, in a model of subcutaneous pancreatic cancer, treatment of tumor-bearing mice with CCR4-transduced CTL led to the eradication of established tumors in 40% of the mice. In conclusion, CCR4 overexpression in CTL is a promising therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of adoptive T cell transfer (ACT).']	('Rapp', 'Moritz')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27194954	2015	10	A microfluidic approach to parallelized transcriptional profiling of single cells.	['The ability to correlate single-cell genetic information with cellular phenotypes is of great importance to biology and medicine, as it holds the potential to gain insight into disease pathways that is unavailable from ensemble measurements. We present a microfluidic approach to parallelized, rapid, quantitative analysis of messenger RNA from single cells via RT-qPCR. The approach leverages an array of single-cell RT-qPCR analysis units formed by a set of parallel microchannels concurrently controlled by elastomeric pneumatic valves, thereby enabling parallelized handling and processing of single cells in a drastically simplified operation procedure using a relatively small number of microvalves. All steps for single-cell RT-qPCR, including cell isolation and immobilization, cell lysis, mRNA purification, reverse transcription and qPCR, are integrated on a single chip, eliminating the need for off-chip manual cell and reagent transfer and qPCR amplification as commonly used in existing approaches. Additionally, the approach incorporates optically transparent microfluidic components to allow monitoring of single-cell trapping without the need for molecular labeling that can potentially alter the targeted gene expression and utilizes a polycarbonate film as a barrier against evaporation to minimize the loss of reagents at elevated temperatures during the analysis. We demonstrate the utility of the approach by the transcriptional profiling for the induction of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1a and the glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase in single cells from the MCF-7 breast cancer cell line. Furthermore, the methyl methanesulfonate is employed to allow measurement of the expression of the genes in individual cells responding to a genotoxic stress.']	('Sun', 'Hao')	Microfluidics and nanofluidics	Microfluid Nanofluidics	['eng']

People in more distressed marriages had higher post-meal ghrelin (but not leptin) and a poorer quality diet than those in less distressed marriages, but only among participants with a lower BMI.

"[""Deregulation of the IGF system observed in human tumors indicates a role in malignant cell transformation and in tumor cell proliferation. Although overexpression of the IGF2 and IGF1R genes was described in adrenocortical tumors (ACTs), few studies reported their profiles in pediatric ACTs. In this study, the IGF2 and IGF1R expression was evaluated by RT-qPCR according to the patient's clinical/pathological features in 60 pediatric ACT samples, and IGF1R protein was investigated in 45 samples by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Whole transcriptome and functional assays were conducted after IGF1R inhibition with OSI-906 in NCI-H295A cell line. Significant IGF2 overexpression was found in tumor samples when compared with non-neoplastic samples (P<0.001), significantly higher levels of IGF1R in patients with relapse/metastasis (P=0.031) and moderate/strong IGF1R immunostaining in 62.2% of ACTs, but no other relationship with patient survival and clinical/pathological features was observed. OSI-906 treatment downregulated genes associated with MAPK activity, induced limited reduction of cell viability and increased the apoptosis rate. After 24h, the treatment also decreased the expression of genes related to the steroid biosynthetic process, the protein levels of the steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (STAR), and androgen secretion in cell medium, supporting the role of IGF1R in steroidogenesis of adrenocortical carcinoma cells. Our data showed that the IGF1R overexpression could be indicative of aggressive ACTs in children. However, in vitro treatments with high concentrations of OSI-906 (>1?M) showed limited reduction of cell viability, suggesting that OSI-906 alone could not be a suitable therapy to abolish carcinoma cell growth.""]"	('Peixoto Lira', 'Régia Caroline')	Endocrine-related cancer	Endocr.

['Effective cancer treatment needs both, passive and active targeting approaches, to achieve highly specific drug delivery to the target cells while avoiding cytotoxicity to normal cells. Protein drugs are useful in this context because they can display excellent specificity and potency. However, their use in therapeutic formulations is limited due to their physical and chemical instability during storage and administration. Polysaccharides have been used to stabilize proteins during formulation and delivery. To accomplish both, stabilization and targeting simultaneously, the apoptosis-inducing protein cytochrome c (Cyt c) was modified with the polysaccharide hyaluronic acid (HA) because its corresponding receptor CD44 is overexpressed in many cancers. Cyt c-HA bioconjugates were formed using low and high molecular weight HA (8 kDa and 1 MDa) with a resultant Cyt c loading percentage of 4%. Circular dichroism and a cell-free caspase assay showed minor structural changes and high bioactivity (more than 80% caspase activation) of Cyt c, respectively, after bioconjugate formation. Two CD44-positive cancer cells lines, HeLa and A549 cells, and two CD44-negative normal cell lines, Huvec and NIH-3T3 cells, were incubated with the samples to assess selectivity and cytotoxicity. After 24 h of incubation with the samples, cancer cell viability was reduced at least 3-fold while CD44-negative control cell lines remained minimally affected. Fluorescence imaging confirmed selective internalization of the Cyt c-HA construct by CD44-positive cancer cell lines. These results demonstrate the development of a drug delivery system that incorporates passive and active targeting which is essential for cancer treatment.']	('Figueroa', 'Cindy M')	Journal of nanomedicine & nanotechnology	J Nanomed Nanotechnol	['eng']

Although a role for psychological stress in the sickness response, particularly in combination with EBV-encoded deoxyuridine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (dUTPase) has been established, and the role of physical stressors in these interactions remains unspecified. In this study, we seek to determine the interaction of chronic physical (swim) stress and EBV-encoded dUTPase injection. We hypothesize that a chronic physical stressor will exacerbate the sickness response following EBV-encoded dUTPase injection. To test this hypothesis mice receive daily injections of EBV-encoded dUTPase or vehicle and are subjected to 15 min of swim stress each day for 14 days or left unmanipulated. On the final evening of injections mice undergo behavioral testing. EBV-encoded dUTPase injection alone produces some sickness behaviors.

['Although murine xenograft models for human uveal melanoma (UM) are available, they are of limited utility for screening large compound libraries for the discovery of new drugs. We need new preclinical models which can efficiently evaluate drugs that can treat UM metastases. The zebrafish embryonic model is ideal for drug screening purposes because it allows the investigation of potential antitumor properties of drugs within 1 week. The optical transparency of the zebrafish provides unique possibilities for live imaging of fluorescence-labelled cancer cells and their behavior. In addition, the adaptive immune response, which is responsible for the rejection of transplanted material, is not yet present in the early stages of fish development, and systemic immunosuppression is therefore not required to allow growth of tumor cells. We studied the behavior of UM cells following injection into zebrafish embryos and observed different phenotypes. We also analyzed cell migration, proliferation, formation of micrometastasis and interaction with the host microenvironment. Significant differences were noted between cell lines: cells derived from metastases showed more migration and proliferation than cells derived from the primary tumors. The addition of the c-Met inhibitor crizotinib to the water in which the larvae were kept reduced the migration and proliferation of UM cells expressing c-Met. This indicates the applicability of the zebrafish xenografts for testing novel inhibitory compounds and provides a fast and sensitive in vivo vertebrate model for preclinical drug screening to combat UM.']	('van der Ent', 'Wietske')	Ocular oncology and pathology	Ocul Oncol Pathol	['eng']

Subsequently, DNA hydrolysates were separated by LC-MS and Selected Reaction Monitoring (SRM) was employed to identify the nucleobases and nucleosides.

This tumor-initiating cell population plays an important role in maintaining tumor growth through their unlimited self-renewal, therapeutic resistance, and capacity to propagate tumors through asymmetric cell division. Recent findings from multiple laboratories show that cancer progenitor cells have the capacity to de-differentiate and acquire a stem-like phenotype in response to either genetic manipulation or environmental cues. These findings suggest that CSCs and relatively differentiated progenitors coexist in dynamic equilibrium and are subject to bidirectional conversion. In this review, we discuss emerging concepts regarding the stem-like phenotype, its acquisition by cancer progenitor cells, and the molecular mechanisms involved. Understanding the dynamic equilibrium between CSCs and cancer progenitor cells is critical for the development of novel therapeutic strategies that focus on depleting tumors of their tumor-propagating cell population.']	('Lopez-Bertoni', 'Hernando')	Biology and medicine (Aligarh)	Biol Med (Aligarh)	['eng']

A consequence of using less effective designs is that more patients are treated with doses outside the therapeutic window. In June 2012, the U S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) rejected the proposal to use Escalation with Overdose Control (EWOC), an established dose-finding method which has been extensively used in FDA-approved first in human trials and imposed a variation of the MF-UD, known as accelerated titration (AT) design. This event motivated us to perform an extensive simulation study comparing the operating characteristics of AT and EWOC. We show that the AT design has poor operating characteristics relative to three versions of EWOC under several practical scenarios. From the clinical investigator\'s perspective, lower bias and mean square error make EWOC designs preferable than AT designs without compromising safety.

27154598	2015	06	Melanocytic Ophthalmic Neoplasms of the Domestic Veterinary Species: A Review.	['Melanocytic neoplasms in veterinary species occur in various ophthalmic locations including the eyelid, conjunctiva, cornea, sclera, anterior and posterior uvea, and orbit. Histology usually provides the definitive diagnosis for melanocytic ocular neoplasias. The degree of tissue invasiveness and anaplastic cellular characteristics are more reliable indicators of biological behavior than is mitotic index in most ophthalmic melanocytic tumors. Melanocytic neoplasias of the eyelid are predominantly benign in canines and equines, though in felines, there is the potential for metastasis, especially if the conjunctiva is involved. Limbal melanocytic tumors are predominantly benign in all the studied species, though there is a bimodal occurrence with this tumor type in canines, where those that appear in dogs younger than 4 years tended toward active growth, whereas those that appear in dogs older than 8 years tended to progress more slowly, and may not require therapy. The most common location for melanocytic ocular neoplasias in both canines and felines is the anterior uvea. Feline diffuse iris melanoma in particular has a higher incidence of metastasis than does canine nodular anterior uveal melanocytoma. In contrast, posterior uveal melanocytic tumors are rare in both canine and feline species and are considered benign. Orbital melanoma is rare in both canine and feline species; however, it generally carries a grave prognosis owing to its malignant nature. Knowledge of the general biological behavior and its variability among locations within the eye and between species is essential in therapeutic planning.']	('Wang', 'Annie L')	Topics in companion animal medicine	Top Companion Anim Med	['eng']

Computed tomography (CT) revealed a 50 mm mass with irregular contrast enhancement in the anterior mediastinum. ?-fetoprotein (AFP) level was elevated to 1188\u2009ng/mL. A germ cell tumor was diagnosed, mostly comprising of a yolk sac tumor (YST). Two courses of chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and etoposide (VP16) were administered and surgical tumor resection was then performed. The final diagnosis was YST. CDDP and VP16 were continued postoperatively; however, because the AFP level increased about six months after surgery, the chemotherapy regimen was altered to bleomycin and CPT-11. As the AFP again increased and a CT scan revealed tumor re-enlargement, recurrent YST was diagnosed and radiotherapy was administered. The patient received a total of 60 Gy (2 Gy per fraction). The tumor started to shrink during radiotherapy and AFP levels decreased. By one month post-radiotherapy, AFP levels had normalized and the tumor had disappeared. As of six years after radiotherapy, the patient remains alive without recurrence. Mediastinal YSTs are rare, and treatment usually includes surgery and preoperative and postoperative chemotherapy with cisplatin-based regimens. Successful treatment with radiotherapy has occasionally been reported. Our patient showed recurrence of a YST after surgery and chemotherapy, but achieved long-term survival after radiotherapy. Few patients with YST have undergone radiotherapy, but this approach was successful in our patient. In cases of postoperative recurrent YST resistant to chemotherapy, radiotherapy, together with salvage surgery, may offer a valuable option.']	('Sakaguchi', 'Masakuni')	Thoracic cancer	Thorac Cancer	['eng']

['Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and its mutant form EGFRvIII are overexpressed in a large proportion of glioblastomas (GBM). Immunotherapy with an EGFRvIII-specific vaccine has shown efficacy against GBM in clinical studies. However, immune escape by antigen-loss variants and lack of control of EGFR wild-type positive clones limit the usefulness of this approach. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-engineered natural killer (NK) cells may represent an alternative immunotherapeutic strategy. For targeting to GBM, we generated variants of the clinically applicable human NK cell line NK-92 that express CARs carrying a composite CD28-CD3? domain for signaling, and scFv antibody fragments for cell binding either recognizing EGFR, EGFRvIII, or an epitope common to both antigens. In vitro analysis revealed high and specific cytotoxicity of EGFR-targeted NK-92 against established and primary human GBM cells, which was dependent on EGFR expression and CAR signaling. EGFRvIII-targeted NK-92 only lysed EGFRvIII-positive GBM cells, while dual-specific NK cells expressing a cetuximab-based CAR were active against both types of tumor cells. In immunodeficient mice carrying intracranial GBM xenografts either expressing EGFR, EGFRvIII or both receptors, local treatment with dual-specific NK cells was superior to treatment with the corresponding monospecific CAR NK cells. This resulted in a marked extension of survival without inducing rapid immune escape as observed upon therapy with monospecific effectors. Our results demonstrate that dual targeting of CAR NK cells reduces the risk of immune escape and suggest that EGFR/EGFRvIII-targeted dual-specific CAR NK cells may have potential for adoptive immunotherapy of glioblastoma.']	('Genßler', 'Sabrina')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

"[""The tumor microenvironment (TME) contains high levels of the Wnt family of ligands, and aberrant Wnt-signaling occurs in many tumors. Past studies have been directed toward how the Wnt signaling cascade regulates cancer development, progression and metastasis. However, its effects on host antitumor immunity remain unknown. In this report, we show that Wnts in the TME condition dendritic cells (DCs) to a regulatory state and suppress host antitumor immunity. DC-specific deletion of Wnt co-receptors low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 and 6 (LRP5/6) in mice markedly delayed tumor growth and enhanced host antitumor immunity. Mechanistically, loss of LRP5/6-mediated signaling in DCs resulted in enhanced effector T cell differentiation and decreased regulatory T cell differentiation. This was due to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and decreased production of IL-10, TGF-?1 and retinoic acid (RA). Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of the Wnts' interaction with its cognate co-receptors LRP5/6 and Frizzled (Fzd) receptors had similar effects on tumor growth and effector T cell responses. Moreover, blocking Wnt-signaling in DCs resulted in enhanced capture of tumor-associated antigens and efficient cross-priming of CD8+ T cells. Hence, blocking the Wnt pathway represents a potential therapeutic to overcome tumor-mediated immune suppression and augment antitumor immunity.""]"	('Hong', 'Yuan')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

We also determined galectin-1 (gal-1), involved in angiogenesis and tumor-mediated immune evasion. We found significantly lower levels of IL-10, VEGF-A, TGF-? and arginase and higher levels of gal-1 after chemotherapy compared to diagnosis. After debulking surgery, a decrease in IL-10 was significant. Gal-1 and CCL-2 appeared independent prognostic factors for progression-free and overall survival (OS) (multivariate analysis).

['Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) play a controversial role in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and prognosis of colorectal cancer (CRC). In particular, the microlocalization, polarization and prognostic impact of TAM in the immediate environment of invading CRC cells has not yet been established. To address this clinically relevant question, intraepithelial (iCD68) and stromal macrophages (sCD68), M1-macrophages (iNOS), M2-macrophages (CD163), cytokeratin-positive cancer cells (tumor buds) and expression of the anti-phagocytic marker CD47 were investigated in primary tumors of 205 well-characterized CRC patients. Cell-to-cell contacts between tumor buds and TAM were detected using high-resolution digital scans. The composition of the tumor microenvironment was analyzed with clinicopathological and molecular features. High CD68 counts predicted long term overall survival independent of microlocalization (iCD68 p=0.0016; sCD68 p=0.03), pT, pN, pM and post-operative therapy. CD68 infiltration correlated with significantly less tumor budding (iCD68 p=0.0066; sCD68 p=0.0091) and absence of lymph node metastasis (sCD68 p=0.0286). Cell-to-cell contact of sCD68 and invading cancer cells was frequent and ameliorated the detrimental prognostic effect of the tumor budding phenotype. Subgroup analysis identified long-term survival with CD47 loss and predominance of CD163+ M2 macrophages (p = 0.0366). CD163+ macrophages represented 40% of the total population, and positively correlated with total CD68 macrophage numbers (r[CD68/CD163] = 0.32; p = 0.0001). Strong CD163 infiltration predicted lower tumor grade (p = 0.0026) and less lymph node metastasis (p = 0.0056). This study provides direct morphological evidence of an interaction between TAM and infiltrating cancer cells. The prognostic impact of TAM is modulated by phenotype, microlocalization and the expression of anti-phagocytic markers in CRC.']	('Koelzer', 'Viktor H')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Previous vaccination studies in patients with castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) showed improved survival without prolongation of progression-free survival (PFS). This might be explained by enhanced efficacy of subsequent therapies because of heightened immune status. We therefore evaluated the efficacy of chemotherapy in CRPC patients after immunotherapy. We retrospectively analyzed 28 patients who were treated with ipilimumab and GVAX, an allogeneic vaccine, and 21 patients who were randomized to GVAX or no vaccination. To study whether immune status was related to the efficacy of chemotherapy, frequencies of myeloid and lymphocyte subsets were determined. Of 28 patients treated with GVAX and ipilimumab, 23 patients received docetaxel and 13 patients mitoxantrone. Median PFS after docetaxel was 6.4 mo (range 0.8-11.2), while median PFS after mitoxantrone was markedly longer than expected (4.8 mo; range 1.4-13.7). High CD8+ICOS+ Tcell/Treg and pDC/mMDSC ratios were associated with relatively long PFS after mitoxantrone, suggesting a correlation between activated immune status and benefit of mitoxantrone. Analysis of 21 patients, randomized to GVAX or not, revealed a median PFS after docetaxel of 9.9 mo for vaccinated patients and 7.1 mo for unvaccinated patients. Interestingly, PFS after mitoxantrone (n =\xa014) was significantly longer in vaccinated patients as compared to controls (5.9\xa0vs. 1.6 mo, p\xa0=\xa00.0048). In conclusion, mitoxantrone seems more effective in CRPC patients after immunotherapy, which may be related to the immune-stimulating effect of mitoxantrone in patients with heightened antitumor immunity. As this was a retrospective study with limited sample size, prospective studies are warranted to definitively show proof of principle.']	('van Dodewaard-de Jong', 'Joyce M')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27141389	2016	10	Oncolytic adenoviruses coated with MHC-I tumor epitopes increase the antitumor immunity and efficacy against melanoma.	['The stimulation of the immune system using oncolytic adenoviruses (OAds) has attracted significant interest and several studies suggested that OAds immunogenicity might be important for their efficacy. Therefore, we developed a versatile and rapid system to adsorb tumor-specific major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I) peptides onto the viral surface to drive the immune response toward the tumor epitopes. By studying the model epitope SIINFEKL, we demonstrated that the peptide-coated OAd (PeptiCRAd) retains its infectivity and the cross presentation of the modified-exogenous epitope on MHC-I is not hindered. We then showed that the SIINFEKL-targeting PeptiCRAd achieves a superior antitumor efficacy and increases the percentage of antitumor CD8+ T cells and mature epitope-specific dendritic cells in vivo. PeptiCRAds loaded with clinically relevant tumor epitopes derived from tyrosinase-related protein 2 (TRP-2) and human gp100 could reduce the growth of primary-treated tumors and secondary-untreated melanomas, promoting the expansion of antigen-specific T-cell populations. Finally, we tested PeptiCRAd in humanized mice bearing human melanomas. In this model, a PeptiCRAd targeting the human melanoma-associated antigen A1 (MAGE-A1) and expressing granulocyte and macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) was able to eradicate established tumors and increased the human MAGE-A1-specific CD8+ T cell population. Herein, we show that the immunogenicity of OAds plays a key role in their efficacy and it can be exploited to direct the immune response system toward exogenous tumor epitopes. This versatile and rapid system overcomes the immunodominance of the virus and elicits a tumor-specific immune response, making PeptiCRAd a promising approach for clinical testing.']	('Capasso', 'Cristian')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

27141387	2016	10	Regulatory T cells that co-express ROR?t and FOXP3 are pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive and expand in human pancreatic cancer.	['Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is highly infiltrated by CD4+T cells that express ROR?t and IL-17 (TH17). Compelling evidence from the tumor microenvironment suggest that regulatory T cells (Treg) contribute to TH17 mediated inflammation. Concurrently, PDAC patients have elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines that may lead to TH17 associated functional plasticity in Treg. In this study, we investigated the phenotype and functional properties of Treg in patients with PDAC. We report that PDAC patients have elevated frequency of FOXP3+Treg, which exclusively occurred within the FOXP3+ROR?t+Treg compartment. The FOXP3+ROR?t+Treg retained FOXP3+Treg markers and represented an activated subset. The expression of ROR?t in Treg may indicate a phenotypic switch toward TH17 cells. However, the FOXP3+ROR?t+Treg produced both TH17 and TH2 associated pro-inflammatory cytokines, which corresponded with elevated TH17 and TH2 immune responses in PDAC patients. Both the FOXP3+Treg and FOXP3+ROR?t+Treg from PDAC patients strongly suppressed T cell immune responses, but they had impaired anti-inflammatory properties. We conclude that FOXP3+ROR?t+Treg have a dual phenotype with combined pro-inflammatory and immunosuppressive activity, which may be involved in the pathogenesis of PDAC.']	('Chellappa', 'Stalin')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27141386	2016	12	Gene expression profiling of circulating tumor cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from breast cancer patients.	['Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that are released from a tumor into the bloodstream. The presence of CTCs in peripheral blood has been associated with metastasis formation in patients with breast cancer. Therefore, the molecular characterization of CTCs may improve diagnostics and support treatment decisions. We performed gene expression profiling to evaluate the enriched CTCs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of breast cancer patients using an expression panel of 55 breast cancer-associated genes. The study revealed several significantly differentially expressed genes in the CTC-positive samples, including a few that were exclusively expressed in these cells. However, the expression of these genes was barely detectable in the PBMC samples. Some genes were differentially expressed in PBMCs, and the expression of these genes was correlated with tumor grade and the formation of metastasis. In this study, we have shown that the enriched CTCs of breast cancer patients overexpress genes involved in proteolytic degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM) as well as genes that play important roles in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) process that may occur in these cells.']	('Hensler', 'Michal')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['The purpose of combining targeted agents and immunotherapy is to achieve a chance of long-term tumor control in highly advanced patients. Between April 2012 and December 2013, 10 patients with metastatic melanoma were treated with a combination treatment of vemurafenib and ipilimumab as an individual treatment decision after detailed information and giving written informed consent. All the patients had advanced symptomatic disease, seven with elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and six with brain metastases on MRI. After clinical improvement under vemurafenib monotherapy (median 11.5\xa0weeks), four cycles of ipilimumab were administered additionally. Combination treatment was tolerated well, with only two patients developing ? grade 3 elevation of transaminases; this was asymptomatic and resolved on cessation of BRAF inhibitor treatment. Staging 12\xa0weeks after initiation of ipilimumab revealed partial response for five patients, stable disease for two, and disease progression for three. Of the seven patients with disease control, we stopped vemurafenib for five, to determine whether ipilimumab treatment led to disease control. Two revealed progressive disease 2\xa0mo later, and received vemurafenib again, but for three the disease was controlled for at least a year, and two are still in partial remission without any further treatment. Progression-free survival was a median of 8.0\xa0mo (95% CI 4.8-11.2), overall survival (OS) was 13.0\xa0mo (95% CI 5.0-21.0), and four patients are still alive. In conclusion, the combination of vemurafenib and ipilimumab was well tolerated and clinical outcome was promising.

Here, we present the results of the TSPP/VAC1/arm C trial aimed to evaluate TSPP in combination with chemo-immunotherapy in pretreated metastatic colo-rectal cancer (mCRC) pts. Twenty-nine pts, 14 males and 15 females, received poly-chemotherapy with gemcitabine [GEM; 1,000\xa0mg/sqm, day-1], oxaliplatin [OX; 80\xa0mg/sqm, day-2], levofolinate [100\xa0mg/sqm, days 1-2], bolus/infusional 5'-FU [400\xa0mg/800\xa0mg/sqm, days 1-2], sargramostim [50\xa0?g, days 3-7/q30], and interleukin-2 [sc. 0.5 MIU twice a day, days 8-14/18-30] [GOLFIG-regimen].

['We conducted a phase II clinical trial of anti-CTLA-4 antibody (ipilimumab) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) in 22 patients with metastatic melanoma and determined clinical outcomes and immunologic responses. The treatment consisted of a 3-mo induction with ipilimumab at 10\xa0mg/kg administered every 3\xa0weeks for four doses in combination with GM-CSF at 125\xa0µg/m2 for 14\xa0d beginning on the day of the ipilimumab infusion and then GM-CSF for 3\xa0mo on the same schedule without ipilimumab. This was followed by maintenance therapy with the combination every 3\xa0mo for up to 2\xa0y or until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood samples for determination of immune subsets were obtained before treatment, at week 3 (end of cycle 1) and at week 6 (end of cycle 2). Blood samples were also obtained from seven subjects who were cancer-free. The immune response disease control (irDC) rate at 24\xa0weeks was 41% and the overall response rate (ORR) was 32%. The median progression free-survival (PFS) was 3.5\xa0mo and the median overall survival (OS) was 21.1\xa0mo. 41% of the patients experienced Grade 3 to 4 adverse events. We conclude that this combination is safe and the results suggest the combination may be more effective than ipilimumab monotherapy. Further, the results suggest that lower levels of CD4+ effector T cells but higher levels of CD8+ T cells expressing PD-1 at pre-treatment could be a potential biomarker for disease control in patients who receive immunotherapy with ipilimumab and GM-CSF. Further trials of this combination are warranted.']	('Kwek', 'Serena S')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27141382	2016	10	Trastuzumab upregulates expression of HLA-ABC and T cell costimulatory molecules through engagement of natural killer cells and stimulation of IFN? secretion.	['It is increasingly recognized that trastuzumab, an antibody approved for treating human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing breast cancer, exerts some of its antitumor effects through enhanced T cell responses. Full activation of CD8+ T cells requires both expression of major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (HLA-ABC) and expression of the T cell costimulatory molecule CD80 or CD86; however, the impact of trastuzumab treatment on the expression of HLA-ABC and CD80 and CD86 has not been investigated in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells. In this study, we found that, while there is no direct correlation between the expression of HER2 and HLA-ABC in breast cancer, knockdown of HER2 or inhibition of HER2 kinase by lapatinib downregulated HLA-ABC expression. Trastuzumab had no meaningful effects on HLA-ABC expression in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells in monoculture; however, treatment of such cells with trastuzumab in co-culture with human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) significantly upregulated not only HLA-ABC expression but also CD86 expression. We showed that this upregulation was mediated by interferon gamma (IFN?) secreted from the natural killer (NK) cells in PBMC as a result of engagement of NK cells by trastuzumab. We further confirmed this effect of trastuzumab in vivo using a mouse mammary tumor model transduced to overexpress human HER2. Together, our data provide evidence that trastuzumab upregulates expression of HLA-ABC and T cell costimulatory molecules in HER2-overexpressing breast cancer cells in the presence of PBMC, which supports the view that T-cell-mediated immune responses are involved in trastuzumab-mediated antitumor effects.']	('Chaganty', 'Bharat K R')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27141381	2016	11	Immunological correlates of treatment and response in stage IV malignant melanoma patients treated with Ipilimumab.	['Introduction: Ipilimumab is effective in the treatment of metastatic malignant melanoma, but few biomarkers reliably predict treatment response. Methods: Patients were treated with Ipilimumab for metastatic malignant melanoma. Blood and serum samples were collected before and during treatment. Mononuclear cells in peripheral blood were subjected to immune phenotypic analyses and cytokine levels were measured in serum samples. Results were correlated with clinical data. Results: A total of 40 patients were included in the analyses. Clinical response were associated with an increase after one series of treatment in absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) (p = 0.008), absolute T cell count (p = 0.02) and the absolute number of activated T cells in peripheral blood (p = 0.003). A high frequency of myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSC) and a higher level of IL6 were associated with treatment failure, though not significantly. Levels of IL6 in serum above the median showed a tendency to associate with reduced survival by the 4th treatment series. Finally, treatment with Ipilimumab led to a decreased frequency of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells (p = 0.009). Conclusion: Ipilimumab leads to increased ALC, T cell count and T cell activation in malignant melanoma patients responding to treatment. A high baseline frequency of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and high levels of IL6 is associated with a reduced chance of responding to therapy.']	('Bjoern', 'Jon')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Recently, there has been a growing interest in the importance of stem cells (SCs) in the development/progression of gastric neoplasms. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of different populations of bone-marrow-derived stem cells (BMSCs) in patients with various types of gastric malignancies, including gastric cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs), neuroendocrine neoplasms (NENs), and lymphomas. We found significantly lower numbers of circulating Lin-/CD45\u200a+/\u200aCD133\u200a+ hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and intensified peripheral trafficking of both Lin-/CD45-/CXCR4+/CD34+/CD133+ very small embryonic/epiblast-like stem cells (VSELs) and CD105\u200a+\u200a/STRO-1\u200a+/\u200aCD45- mesenchymal SCs (MSCs) in patients with gastric cancer, but not in those with other types of gastric neoplasms. No significant differences in the absolute numbers of circulating CD34\u200a+/\u200aKDR\u200a+/\u200aCD31\u200a+/\u200aCD45- endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) were observed between the groups. This abnormal balance in the peripheral trafficking of BMSCs in patients with gastric cancer was neither associated with clinical stage of the disease nor with systemic levels of stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), as these were comparable to the values observed in control individuals. Interestingly, the absolute numbers of circulating BMSCs correlated with the concentrations of complement cascade-derived anaphylatoxins/molecules (mainly C5b-9/membrane attack complex-MAC) and sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P). In summary, our translational study revealed that abnormal peripheral trafficking of BMSCs occurs in patients with gastric cancer, but not in those with other types of gastric neoplasms. Further, our findings indicate that highlighted complement cascade-derived molecules and S1P, but not SDF-1, are significant players associated with this phenomenon.']	('B?ogowski', 'Wojciech')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27141379	2016	10	Overexpression of KIR inhibitory ligands (HLA-I) determines that immunosurveillance of myeloma depends on diverse and strong NK cell licensing.	"['Missing self recognition makes cancer sensitive to natural killer cell (NKc) reactivity. However, this model disregards the NKc licensing effect, which highly increases NKc reactivity through interactions of inhibitory killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (iKIR) with their cognate HLA-I ligands. The influence of iKIR/HLA-ligand (HLA-C1/C2) licensing interactions on the susceptibility to and progression of plasma cell (PC) dyscrasias was evaluated in 164 Caucasian patients and 286 controls. Compared to controls, myeloma accumulates KIR2DL1-L2+L3- genotypes (2.8% vs. 13.2%, p\xa0< 0.01, OR =\xa05.29) and less diverse peripheral repertoires of NKc clones. Less diverse and weaker-affinity repertoires of iKIR2D/HLA-C licensing interactions increased myeloma susceptibility. Thus, the complete absence of conventional iKIR2D/HLA-C licensing interactions (KIR2DL1-L2+L3-/C2C2, 2.56% vs. 0.35%; p < 0.05; OR =\xa015.014), single-KIR2DL3+/C1+ (20.51% vs. 10.84%; p < 0.05; OR =\xa02.795) and single-KIR2DL2+/C1+ (12.82% vs. 4.9%; p < 0.01; OR =\xa05.18) interactions were over-represented in myeloma, compared to controls. Additionally, KIR2DL1-L2+L3- (20% vs. 83%, p < 0.00001) as well as KIR3DL1- (23% vs. 82%, p < 0.00001) genotypes had a dramatic negative impact on the 3-y progression-free survival (PFS), particularly in patients with low-tumor burden. Remarkably, myeloma-PCs, compared to K562 and other hematological cancers, showed substantial over-expression of HLA-I (""increasing-self"" instead of missing-self), including HLA-C, and mild expression of ligands for NKc activating receptors (aRec) CD112, CD155, ULBP-1 and MICA/B, which apparently renders myeloma-PCs susceptible to lysis mainly by licensed NKc. KIR2DL1-L2+L3-/C2C2 patients (with no conventional iKIR2D/HLA-C licensing interactions) lyse K562 but barely lyse myeloma-PCs (4% vs. 15%; p < 0.05, compared to controls). These results support a model where immunosurveillance of no-missing-self cancers, e.g., myeloma, mainly depends on NKc licensing.']"	('Martínez-Sánchez', 'María V')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27141376	2016	09	Spatial distribution of B cells predicts prognosis in human pancreatic adenocarcinoma.	['B-cell responses are emerging as critical regulators of cancer progression. In this study, we investigated the role of B lymphocytes in the microenvironment of human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), in a retrospective consecutive series of 104 PDAC patients and in PDAC preclinical models. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that B cells occupy two histologically distinct compartments in human PDAC, either scatteringly infiltrating (CD20-TILs), or organized in tertiary lymphoid tissue (CD20-TLT). Only when retained within TLT, high density of B cells predicted longer survival (median survival 16.9 mo CD20-TLThi vs. 10.7 mo CD20-TLTlo; p = 0.0085). Presence of B cells within TLT associated to a germinal center (GC) immune signature, correlated with CD8-TIL infiltration, and empowered their favorable prognostic value. Immunotherapeutic vaccination of spontaneously developing PDAC (KrasG12D-Pdx1-Cre) mice with ?-enolase (ENO1) induced formation of TLT with active GCs and correlated with increased recruitment of T lymphocytes, suggesting induction of TLT as a strategy to favor mobilization of immune cells in PDAC. In contrast, in an implanted tumor model devoid of TLT, depletion of B cells with an anti-CD20 antibody reinstated an antitumor immune response. Our results highlight B cells as an essential element of the microenvironment of PDAC and identify their spatial organization as a key regulator of their antitumor function. A mindfully evaluation of B cells in human PDAC could represent a powerful prognostic tool to identify patients with distinct clinical behaviors and responses to immunotherapeutic strategies.']	('Castino', 'Giovanni Francesco')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Dendritic cell-derived exosomes (Dex) are small extracellular vesicles secreted by viable dendritic cells. In the two phase-I trials that we conducted using the first generation of Dex (IFN-?-free) in end-stage cancer, we reported that Dex exerted natural killer (NK) cell effector functions in patients. A second generation of Dex (IFN-?-Dex) was manufactured with the aim of boosting NK and T cell immune responses. We carried out a phase II clinical trial testing the clinical benefit of IFN-?-Dex loaded with MHC class I- and class II-restricted cancer antigens as maintenance immunotherapy after induction chemotherapy in patients bearing inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without tumor progression. The primary endpoint was to observe at least 50% of patients with progression-free survival (PFS) at 4 mo after chemotherapy cessation. Twenty-two patients received IFN-?-Dex. One patient exhibited a grade three hepatotoxicity. The median time to progression was 2.2 mo and median overall survival (OS) was 15 mo. Seven patients (32%) experienced stabilization of >4 mo. The primary endpoint was not reached. An increase in NKp30-dependent NK cell functions were evidenced in a fraction of these NSCLC patients presenting with defective NKp30 expression. Importantly, MHC class II expression levels of the final IFN-?-Dex product correlated with expression levels of the NKp30 ligand BAG6 on Dex, and with NKp30-dependent NK functions, the latter being associated with longer progression-free survival. This phase II trial confirmed the capacity of Dex to boost the NK cell arm of antitumor immunity in patients with advanced NSCLC.']	('Besse', 'Benjamin')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27141372	2016	06	Hypoxic tumor-derived microvesicles negatively regulate NK cell function by a mechanism involving TGF-? and miR23a transfer.	['Tumor-derived microvesicles (TD-MVs) are key mediators which are shed by cancer cells and can sensitize neighboring cells in the tumor microenvironment. TD-MVs are extracellular vesicles composed of exosomes and MVs and promote cancer invasion and metastasis. Intratumoral hypoxia is an integral component of all solid tumors. The relationship between hypoxic tumor-shed MVs and NK-mediated cytotoxicity remains unknown. In this paper, we reported that MVs derived from hypoxic tumor cells qualitatively differ from those derived from normoxic tumor cells. Using multiple tumor models, we showed that hypoxic MVs inhibit more NK cell function as compared to normoxic MVs. Hypoxic TD-MVs package two immunosuppressive factors involved in the impairment of natural killer (NK) cell cytotoxicity against different tumor cells in vitro and in vivo. We showed that following their uptake by NK cells, hypoxic TD-MVs transfer TGF-?1 to NK cells, decreasing the cell surface expression of the activating receptor NKG2D, thereby inhibiting NK cell function. MicroRNA profiling revealed the presence of high levels of miR-210 and miR-23a in hypoxic TD-MVs. We demonstrated that miR-23a in hypoxic TD-MVs operates as an additional immunomosuppressive factor, since it directly targets the expression of CD107a in NK cells. To our knowledge, this is the first study to show that hypoxic tumor cells by secreting MVs can educate NK cells and decrease their antitumor immune response. This study highlights the existence of a novel mechanism of immune suppression mediated by hypoxic TD-MVs and further improves our understanding of the immunosuppressive mechanisms prevailing in the hypoxic tumor microenvironment.']	('Berchem', 'Guy')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

"['Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) have been implicated in the promotion of breast cancer growth and metastasis, and a strong infiltration by TAMs has been associated with estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors and poor prognosis. However, the molecular mechanisms behind these observations are unclear. We investigated macrophage activation in response to co-culture with several breast cancer cell lines (T47D, MCF-7, BT-474, SKBR-3, Cal-51 and MDA-MB-231) and found that high granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) secretion by the triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) cell line MDA-MB-231 gave rise to immunosuppressive HLA-DRlo macrophages that promoted migration of breast cancer cells via secretion of TGF-?. In human breast cancer samples (n = 548), G-CSF was highly expressed in TNBC (p < 0.001) and associated with CD163+ macrophages (p < 0.0001), poorer overall survival (OS) (p = 0.021) and significantly increased numbers of TGF-?+ cells. While G-CSF blockade in the 4T1 mammary tumor model promoted maturation of MHCIIhi blood monocytes and TAMs and significantly reduced lung metastasis, anti-CSF-1R treatment promoted MHCIIloF4/80hiMRhi anti-inflammatory TAMs and enhanced lung metastasis in the presence of high G-CSF levels. Combined anti-G-CSF and anti-CSF-1R therapy significantly increased lymph node metastases, possibly via depletion of the so-called ""gate-keeper"" subcapsular sinus macrophages. These results indicate that G-CSF promotes the anti-inflammatory phenotype of tumor-induced macrophages when CSF-1R is inhibited and therefore caution against the use of M-CSF/CSF-1R targeting agents in tumors with high G-CSF expression.']"	('Hollmén', 'Maija')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Programmed cell death (PD)-1/PD-1 ligand-1 (PD-L1)-targeted therapy has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy for lung cancer. However, whether EML4-ALK regulates PD-L1 expression in lung cancer remains unknown. A total of 532 pulmonary adenocarcinomas (pADCs), including 58 ALK-translocated tumors, were immunohistochemically evaluated for PD-L1 and PD-1. H23 (EGFRWild-typeEML4-ALK-PD-L1Low) and H2228 (EGFRWild-typeEML4-ALK+PD-L1High) cells were transfected with EML4-ALK or ALK short interfering RNAs and used to investigate the alterations in PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 expression was detected in 81% of ALK-translocated pADCs; this value was significantly higher than those of pADCs with EGFR mutation, KRAS mutation or lacking ALK, EGFR or KRAS mutation (p <0.005 for all). Moreover, ALK-translocated pADC with PD-L1 expression showed significantly higher numbers of tumor-infiltrating PD-1+ cells. ALK knockdown or inhibition (crizotinib treatment) in H2228 cells downregulated PD-L1 expression. Transfection of H23 cells with EML4-ALK enhanced PD-L1 expression, which was compromised by crizotinib treatment. This ALK-dependent upregulation of PD-L1 expression was mediated by STAT3 and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1? under normoxia and hypoxia. Furthermore, EML4-ALK enhanced HIF-1? expression through increasing transcription and decreasing ubiquitination of HIF-1?. In ALK-translocated pADC tissues, significant positive correlations between PD-L1 and nuclear HIF-1? (p < 0.05) or pSTAT3 expression levels (p<0.005) were observed. Among patients with ALK-translocated pADC, strong PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with shorter progression-free (p = 0.001) and overall survival (p = 0.002) after crizotinib treatment. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that ALK-derived pADCs increase PD-L1 expression via HIF-1? and/or STAT3, thus providing a rationale for PD-1/PD-L1 pathway-targeted therapy in ALK-translocated lung cancer.']	('Koh', 'Jaemoon')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Monitoring functional competence of immune cell populations in clinical routine represents a major challenge. We developed a whole-blood assay to monitor functional competence of peripheral innate immune cells including NK cells, dendritic and monocyte cell subsets through their ability to produce specific cytokines after short-term stimulation, detected through intra-cytoplasmic staining and multi-parametric flow-cytometry. A PMA/ionomycin T cell activation assay complemented this analysis. Comparing cohorts of healthy women and breast cancer (BC) patients at different stages, we identified significant functional alteration of circulating immune cells during BC progression prior to initiation of treatment. Of upmost importance, as early as the localized primary tumor (PT) stage, we observed functional alterations in several innate immune populations and T cells i.e. (i) reduced TNF? production by BDCA-1+ DC and non-classical monocytes in response to Type-I IFN, (ii) a strong drop in IFN? production by NK cells in response to either Type-I IFN or TLR7/8 ligand, and (iii) a coordinated impairment of cytokine (IL-2, IFN?, IL-21) production by T cell subpopulations. Overall, these alterations are further accentuated according to the stage of the disease in first-line metastatic patients. Finally, whereas we did not detect functional modification of DC subsets in response to TLR7/8 ligand, we highlighted increased IL-12p40 production by monocytes specifically at first relapse (FR).

['Although immunotherapy is an attractive approach for cancer treatment, increasing evidence has shown that the combination of immunotherapy with other treatment modalities may improve the outcome of advanced malignancy. We combined the anticancer drug gemcitabine (Gem) with recombinant lipoprotein-based immunotherapy (rlipo-E7m/CpG) to treat advanced cancer. Mice bearing huge solid tumors (? 12\xa0mm in diameter) or orthotopic cervical cancer were treated with a therapeutic regimen consisting of rlipo-E7m/CpG and Gem. In addition, tumor-infiltrating immune cells were quantified by flow cytometry following the chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. We observed the eradication of huge tumors following the administration of Gem on days 21, 24, and 27 or following rlipo-E7m/CpG therapy on day 30 post-tumor implantation. The combination therapy substantially reduced the number of immunosuppressive cells (CD11b+Gr-1+, CD11b+F4/80+, and CD4+CD25+FOXP3+) and increased the number of tumor-infiltrating antigen-specific CD8+ T cells compared to Gem or rlipo-E7m/CpG monotherapy. Interestingly, the administration of Gem and rlipo-E7m/CpG reduced the quantity of programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1)-expressing antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) in the regressing tumors. These findings demonstrated that Gem enhances the eradication of huge tumors by inhibiting a broad range of immunosuppressive cells when combined with immunotherapy. Based on the promising results from this animal study, Gem chemotherapy combined with recombinant lipoimmunogen-based immunotherapy represents a feasible approach for cancer therapy.']	('Chang', 'Li-Sheng')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Driver mutations were reported to upregulate programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. However, how PD-L1 expression and immune function was affected by ALK-TKIs and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment in ALK positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains poorly understood. In the present study, western-blot, real-time PCR, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence were employed to explore how PD-L1 was regulated by ALK fusion protein. ALK-TKIs and relevant inhibitors were used to identify the downstream signaling pathways involved in PD-L1 regulation. Cell apoptosis, viability and Elisa test were used to study the immune suppression by ALK activation and immune reactivation by ALK-TKIs and/or PD-1 blocking in tumor cells and DC-CIK cells co-culture system. We found that PD-L1 expression was associated with EGFR mutations and ALK fusion genes in NSCLC cell lines. Over-expression of ALK fusion protein increased PD-L1 expression. PD-L1 mediated by ALK fusion protein increased the apoptosis of T cells in tumor cells and DC-CIK cells co-culture system. Inhibiting ALK by sensitive TKIs could enhance the production of IFN?. Anti-PD-1 antibody was effective in both crizotinib sensitive and resistant NSCLC cells. Synergistic tumor killing effects were not observed with ALK-TKIs and anti-PD-1 antibody combination in co-culture system. ALK-TKIs not only directly inhibited tumor viability but also indirectly enhanced the antitumor immunity via the downregulation of PD-L1. Anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies could be an optional therapy for crizotinib sensitive, especially crizotinib resistant NSCLC patients with ALK fusion gene. Combination of ALK-TKIs and anti-PD-1/PD-L1 antibodies treatment for ALK positive NSCLC warrants more data before moving into clinical practice.']	('Hong', 'Shaodong')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27141354	2016	10	Small cell lung cancer: Recruitment of macrophages by circulating tumor cells.	['Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) play an important role in tumor progression, suppression of antitumor immunity and dissemination. Blood monocytes infiltrate the tumor region and are primed by local microenvironmental conditions to promote tumor growth and invasion. Although many of the interacting cytokines and factors are known for the tumor-macrophage interactions, the putative contribution of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is not known so far. These specialized cells are characterized by increased mobility, ability to degrade the extracellular matrix (ECM) and to enter the blood stream and generate secondary lesions which is a leading cause of death for the majority of tumor patients. The first establishment of two permanent CTC lines, namely BHGc7 and 10, from blood samples of advanced stage small cell lung cancer (SCLC) patients allowed us to investigate the CTC-immune cell interaction. Cocultures of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMNCs) with CTCs or addition of CTC-conditioned medium (CTC-CM) in vitro resulted in monocyte-macrophage differentiation and appearance of CD14+, CD163weak and CD68+ macrophages expressing markers of TAMs. Furthermore, we screened the supernatants of CTC-primed macrophages for presence of approximately 100 cytokines and compared the expression with those induced by the local metastatic SCLC26A cell line. Macrophages recruited by SCLC26A-CM showed expression of osteopontin (OPN), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), IL-8, chitinase3-like 1 (CHI3L1), platelet factor (Pf4), IL-1ra and matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) among other minor cytokines/chemokines. In contrast, BHGc7-CM induced marked overexpression of complement factor D (CFD)/adipsin and vitamin D-BP (VDBP), as well as increased secretion of OPN, lipocalin-2 (LCN2), CHI3L1, uPAR, MIP-1 and GDF-15/MIC-1. BHGc10, derived independently from relapsed SCLC, revealed an almost identical pattern with added expression of ENA-78/CXCL5. CMs of the non-tumor HEK293 cell line revealed no induction of macrophages, whereas incubation of PBMNCs with recombinant CHI3L1 gave positive results. Thus, the specific contributions of CTCs in SCLC affect CFD/adipsin, possibly involved in immunity/cachexia, VDBP which gives rise to group-specific component protein-derived macrophage-activating factor (GcMAF), GDF-15/MIC-1 which enhances the malignant phenotype of tumor cells and ENA-78/CXCL5 which attracts angiogenic neutrophils. In conclusion, CTCs are competent to specifically manipulate TAMs to increase invasiveness, angiogenesis, immunosuppression and possibly lipid catabolism.']	('Hamilton', 'Gerhard')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['The fetal tight junction molecule claudin 6 (CLDN6) is virtually absent from any normal tissue, whereas it is aberrantly and frequently expressed in various cancers of high medical need. We engineered 6PHU3, a T-cell-engaging bispecific single chain molecule (bi-(scFv)2) with anti-CD3/anti-CLDN6 specificities, and characterized its pharmacodynamic properties. Our data show that upon engagement by 6PHU3, T cells strongly upregulate cytotoxicity and activation markers, proliferate and acquire an effector phenotype. 6PHU3 exerts potent killing of cancer cells in vitro with EC50 values in the pg/mL range. Subcutaneous xenograft tumors in NSG mice engrafted with human PBMCs are eradicated by 6PHU3 treatment and survival of mice is significantly prolonged. Tumors of 6PHU3-treated mice are strongly infiltrated with activated CD4+, CD8+ T cells and TEM type cells but not Tregs and display a general activation of a mostly inflammatory phenotype. These effects are only observed upon bispecific but not monospecific engagement of 6PHU3. Together with the exceptionally cancer cell selective expression of the oncofetal tumor marker CLDN6, this provides a safeguard with regard to toxicity. In summary, our data shows that the concept of T-cell redirection combined with that of highly selective targeting of CLDN6-positive solid tumors is effective. Thus, exploring 6PHU3 for clinical therapy is warranted.']	('Stadler', 'Christiane R')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['We have armed a tumor-selective oncolytic vaccinia virus (vvDD) with the chemokine (CK) CXCL11, in order to enhance its ability to attract CXCR3+ antitumor CTLs and possibly NK cells to the tumor microenvironment (TME) and improve its therapeutic efficacy. As expected, vvDD-CXCL11 attracted high numbers of tumor-specific T cells to the TME in a murine AB12 mesothelioma model. Intratumoral virus-directed CXCL11 expression enhanced local numbers of CD8+ CTLs and levels of granzyme B, while reducing expression of several suppressive molecules, TGF-?, COX2, and CCL22 in the TME. Unexpectedly, we observed that vvDD-CXCL11, but not parental vvDD, induced a systemic increase in tumor-specific IFN?-producing CD8+ T cells in the spleen and other lymph organs, indicating the induction of systemic antitumor immunity. This effect was associated with enhanced therapeutic efficacy and a survival benefit in tumor-bearing mice treated with vvDD-CXCL11, mediated by CD8+ T cells and IFN?, but not CD4+ T cells. These results demonstrate that intratumoral expression of CXCL11, in addition to promoting local trafficking of T cells and to a lesser extent NK cells, has a novel function as a factor eliciting systemic immunity to cancer-associated antigens. Our data provide a rationale for expressing CXCL11 to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of oncolytic viruses (OVs) and cancer vaccines.']	('Liu', 'Zuqiang')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['With checkpoint inhibitors, patients with advanced melanoma display durable responses suggesting cure of disease. However, the immune system has dual roles in cancer; while the immune system may eradicate a tumor, a subtotal elimination may selectively destroy immunogenic cells driving the proliferation of non-immunogenic tumors. Here, we performed a retrospective analysis of results obtained in a controlled trial of patients with melanoma treated with adjuvant, multisubtype interferon-?. The survival curves displayed a late divergence for treated patients and controls resulting in substantially higher estimates of overall (OS) and relapse-free survival (RFS) rates among treated patients after 9\xa0y of follow up. Interestingly, succumbing patients in the treatment group displayed reduced time between relapse and death, suggesting therapy-induced acceleration of disease progression. These findings suggest that effective immunotherapy that induces durable, curative responses in some patients, may potentially accelerate disease progression in others, highlighting the importance of developing advanced strategies to identify patients who are likely to benefit from immunotherapy.']	('Strannegård', 'Örjan')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27141350	2016	10	A novel regulation of PD-1 ligands on mesenchymal stromal cells through MMP-mediated proteolytic cleavage.	['Whether fibroblasts regulate immune response is a crucial issue in the modulation of inflammatory responses. Herein, we demonstrate that foreskin fibroblasts (FFs) potently inhibit CD3+ T cell proliferation through a mechanism involving early apoptosis of activated T cells. Using blocking antibodies, we demonstrate that the inhibition of T cell proliferation occurs through cell-to-cell interactions implicating PD-1 receptor expressed on T cells and its ligands, PD-L1 and PD-L2, on fibroblasts. Dual PD-1 ligand neutralization is required to abrogate (i) binding of the PD-1-Fc fusion protein, (ii) early apoptosis of T cells, and (iii) inhibition of T cell proliferation. Of utmost importance, we provide the first evidence that PD-1 ligand expression is regulated through proteolytic cleavage by endogenous matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) without transcriptional alteration during culture-time. Using (i) different purified enzymatic activities, (ii) MMP-specific inhibitors, and (iii) recombinant human MMP-9 and MMP-13, we demonstrated that in contrast to CD80/CD86, PD-L1 was selectively cleaved by MMP-13, while PD-L2 was sensitive to broader MMP activities. Their cleavage by exogenous MMP-9 and MMP-13 with loss of PD-1 binding domain resulted in the reversion of apoptotic signals on mitogen-activated CD3+ T cells. We suggest that MMP-dependent cleavage of PD-1 ligands on fibroblasts may limit their immunosuppressive capacity and thus contribute to the exacerbation of inflammation in tissues. In contrast, carcinoma-associated fibroblasts appear PD-1 ligand-depleted through MMP activity that may impair physical deletion of exhausted defective memory T cells through apoptosis and facilitate their regulatory functions. These observations should be considered when using the powerful PD-1/PD-L1 blocking immunotherapies.']	('Dezutter-Dambuyant', 'Colette')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Recent studies have demonstrated that regulatory T cells (Tregs) are recruited to tumor sites where they can suppress antitumor immunity. The chemokine receptor CCR4 is expressed at high levels on functional CD4+CD25+FoxP3+ Tregs and production of the CCR4 ligand CCL22 by tumor cells and tumor-associated macrophages is associated with Treg recruitment to the tumor site. Here, we tested IgG1 and IgG4 isotypes of human anti-CCR4 mAb2-3 for their in vitro activity and in vivo capacity in a NSG mouse model bearing CCL22-secreting ovarian cancer (OvCA) xenograft to modulate Tregs and restore antitumor activity. Both mAb2-3 isotypes blocked in vitro chemoattraction of Tregs to CCL22-secreting OvCA cells. However, they differed in their in vivo mode of action with IgG1 causing Treg depletion and IgG4 blocking migration to the tumors. Primary T cells that were primed with OvCA-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) demonstrated INF? secretion that could be enhanced through Treg depletion by mAb2-3. Humanized mice reconstructed with allogeneic tumor-primed T cells (TP-T) were used to evaluate the restoration of OvCA immunity by depletion or blockade of Tregs with mAb2-3. We observed that IgG1 was more potent than IgG4 in inhibiting tumor growth. Mechanism studies demonstrated that mAb2-3 treatment lead to inhibition of IL-2 binding to its receptor. Further studies showed that mAb2-3 induced CD25 shedding (sCD25) from Tregs which lead to a decrease in IL-2-dependent survival. Together, the results demonstrate that mAb2-3 is an agonist antibody that can restore anti-OvCA immunity through modulation of Treg activity.']	('Chang', 'De-Kuan')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['The presence of colony stimulating factor-1 (CSF1)/CSF1 receptor (CSF1R)-driven tumor-infiltrating macrophages and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) is shown to promote targeted therapy resistance. In this study, we demonstrate the superior effect of a combination of CSF1R inhibitor, PLX3397 and BRAF inhibitor, PLX4720, in suppressing primary and metastatic mouse BRAFV600E melanoma. Using flow cytometry to assess SM1WT1 melanoma-infiltrating leukocytes immediately post therapy, we found that PLX3397 reduced the recruitment of CD11b+ Gr1lo and CD11b+ Gr1int M2-like macrophages, but this was accompanied by an accumulation of CD11b+ Gr1hi cells. PDL1 expression on remaining myeloid cells potentially dampened the antitumor efficacy of PLX3397 and PLX4720 in combination, since PD1/PDL1 axis blockade improved outcome. We also reveal a role for PLX3397 in reducing tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, and interestingly, this feature was rescued by the co-administration of PLX4720. Our findings, from three different mouse models of BRAF-mutated melanoma, support clinical approaches that co-target BRAF oncogene and CSF1R.']	('Ngiow', 'Shin Foong')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

To visualize CSCs in vitro by fluorescence imaging, and image and quantify CSCs in tumor xenograft-bearing mice by bioluminescence imaging, HCC cells were engineered with CSC detector vector encoding GFP and luciferase controlled by Nanog promoter. We found that CIK cells have a strong CKA in vitro against putative CSCs of HCC, as shown by tumorsphere formation and time-lapse imaging. Additionally, time-lapse recording firstly revealed that putative CSCs were attacked simultaneously by many CIK cells and finally eradicated by CIK cells, indicating the necessity of achieving sufficient effector-to-target ratios. We firstly illustrated that anti-NKG2D antibody blocking partially but significantly inhibited CKA of CIK cells against putative CSCs. More importantly, intravenous infusion of CIK cells remarkably delayed tumor growth in mice with a significant decrease in putative CSC number monitored by bioluminescence imaging.

Adoptive transfer of PD-1-deficient DCs demonstrated their superior capabilities in inducing antigen-specific CD8+ T cell proliferation in vivo.

The existence of PD-1-expressing HCC-infiltrating DCs (HIDCs) was further supported in a mouse model of HCC. Intratumoral transfer of PD-1-deficient DCs rendered recipient mice resistant to the growth of HCC by promoting tumor-infiltrating CD8+ effector T cells to secrete perforin and granzyme B.

['The glucocorticoid (GC) steroid dexamethasone (Dex) is used as a supportive care co-medication for cancer patients undergoing standard care pemetrexed/platinum doublet chemotherapy. As trials for new cancer immunotherapy treatments increase in prevalence, it is important to track the immunological changes induced by co-medications commonly used in the clinic, but not specifically included in trial design or in pre-clinical models. Here, we document a number of Dex -induced immunological effects, including a large-scale lymphodepletive effect particularly affecting CD4+ T cells but also CD8+ T cells. The proportion of regulatory T cells within the CD4+ compartment did not change after Dex was administered, however a significant increase in proliferation and activation of regulatory T cells was observed. We also noted Dex -induced proportional changes in dendritic cell (DC) subtypes. We discuss these immunological effects in the context of chemoimmunotherapy strategies, and suggest a number of considerations to be taken into account when designing future studies where Dex and other GCs may be in use.']	('Cook', 'Alistair M')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Motesanib is a small molecule and potent multikinase inhibitor with antiangiogenic and antitumor activity. Population pharmacokinetic (POPPK) modeling of motesanib and M4, an active metabolite, was performed to assess sources of variability in cancer patients. The analysis included data collected from 451 patients from 8 clinical trials with oral doses of motesanib ranging from 25 to 175\u2009mg, either once daily or twice daily. The POPPK analyses were performed using nonlinear mixed-effect models with a sequential approach. Covariate effects of demographics and other baseline characteristics were assessed with stepwise covariate modeling. A 2-compartment model with food effect on absorption parameters fitted the PK data of motesanib well. The effects albumin and sex on apparent clearance (CL/F) of motesanib were statistically significant. The albumin effect was more important but remained below a 25% difference. A 1-compartment model fitted PK data of M4 well. Effects of race (Asian vs non-Asian) and dosing frequency were identified as statistically significant covariates on the CL/F of M4. The maximum effect of albumin would result in less than 25% change in motesanib CL/F and as such would not warrant any dosing adjustment.

Seventeen women with HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer received a single oral 0.5-mg dose of digoxin on days 1 and 9 and oral lapatinib 1500 mg once daily on days 2 through 9. Digoxin pharmacokinetic parameters were determined on day 1 (digoxin administration alone) and on day 9 (coadministration of lapatinib and digoxin), and parameters were compared to determine the effects of lapatinib on digoxin absorption. Concomitant medications that could affect ABCB1 were accounted for. Lapatinib 1500\u2009mg/day increased digoxin absorption approximately 80%, implicating lapatinib inhibition of intestinal ABCB1-mediated efflux.

['The structure of genetic interaction networks predicts that, analogous to synthetic lethal interactions between non-essential genes, combinations of compounds with latent activities may exhibit potent synergism. To test this hypothesis, we generated a chemical-genetic matrix of 195 diverse yeast deletion strains treated with 4,915 compounds. This approach uncovered 1,221 genotype-specific inhibitors, which we termed cryptagens. Synergism between 8,128 structurally disparate cryptagen pairs was assessed experimentally and used to benchmark predictive algorithms. A model based on the chemical-genetic matrix and the genetic interaction network failed to accurately predict synergism. However, a combined random forest and Naive Bayesian learner that associated chemical structural features with genotype-specific growth inhibition had strong predictive power. This approach identified previously unknown compound combinations that exhibited species-selective toxicity toward human fungal pathogens. This work demonstrates that machine learning methods trained on unbiased chemical-genetic interaction data may be widely applicable for the discovery of synergistic combinations in different species.']	('Wildenhain', 'Jan')	Cell systems	Cell Syst	['eng']

However, rare functional mutations can escape detection by recurrence analysis owing to lack of statistical power. We enhance statistical power by extending the notion of recurrence of mutations from single genes to gene families that share homologous protein domains. Domain mutation analysis also sharpens the functional interpretation of the impact of mutations, as domains more succinctly embody function than entire genes. By mapping mutations in 22 different tumor types to equivalent positions in multiple sequence alignments of domains, we confirm well-known functional mutation hotspots, identify uncharacterized rare variants in one gene that are equivalent to well-characterized mutations in another gene, detect previously unknown mutation hotspots, and provide hypotheses about molecular mechanisms and downstream effects of domain mutations. With the rapid expansion of cancer genomics projects, protein domain hotspot analysis will likely provide many more leads linking mutations in proteins to the cancer phenotype.']	('Miller', 'Martin L')	Cell systems	Cell Syst	['eng']

27117654	2015	04	Macrophages and cellular immunity in Drosophila melanogaster.	['The invertebrate Drosophila melanogaster has been a powerful model for understanding blood cell development and immunity. Drosophila is a holometabolous insect, which transitions through a series of life stages from embryo, larva and pupa to adulthood. In spite of this, remarkable parallels exist between Drosophila and vertebrate macrophages, both in terms of development and function. More than 90% of Drosophila blood cells (hemocytes) are macrophages (plasmatocytes), making this highly tractable genetic system attractive for studying a variety of questions in macrophage biology. In vertebrates, recent findings revealed that macrophages have two independent origins: self-renewing macrophages, which reside and proliferate in local microenvironments in a variety of tissues, and macrophages of the monocyte lineage, which derive from hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells. Like vertebrates, Drosophila possesses two macrophage lineages with a conserved dual ontogeny. These parallels allow us to take advantage of the Drosophila model when investigating macrophage lineage specification, maintenance and amplification, and the induction of macrophages and their progenitors by local microenvironments and systemic cues. Beyond macrophage development, Drosophila further serves as a paradigm for understanding the mechanisms underlying macrophage function and cellular immunity in infection, tissue homeostasis and cancer, throughout development and adult life.']	('Gold', 'Katrina S')	Seminars in immunology	Semin.

['Thanks to detailed studies conducted in recent years, a new disease syndrome was identified in 2001. It is known as a IgG4-related disease and its differentiation is based on the analysis of IgG4 levels in the affected tissues. The IgG4-related disease is considered to be a generalized pathological process involving a wide spectrum of various disorders that may affect distant organs. Orbital IgG4-related disease is a recently reported issue that may prove important for the elucidation of the etiology of idiopathic, lymphoplasmacytic or fibrotic disorders of various organs, including the orbits. In this article, we are describing epidemiology and differential diagnostics of IgG4-related orbital disease with particular focus on pseudotumors, MALT lymphomas and lymphocyte/plasma cell infiltrations of the orbit.

['Echinacea is used for its immunostimulating properties and may have a role in modulating adverse immune effects of chemotherapy (i.e., use of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU); fluorouracil and its immunosuppressive effect). Patients may seek herbal remedies such as Echinacea (Echinacea angustifolia and Echinacea purpurea) for immune stimulation. Echinacea extracts have been prescribed to supplement cancer chemotherapy for their immune-supportive effects; however, the extracts may also influence tumourgenesis. Our study aimed to determine the proliferative effect of the ethanolic blend of E.\xa0angustifolia and E.\xa0purpurea on various cancer cervical and bile duct cell lines, including HELA and QBC-939. Various cancer cells (HeLa and QBC-939) and human vein epithelial cells (HUVEC) were treated with the Echinacea blend sample that was evaporated and reconstituted in Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). As the extract concentration of Echinacea was increased from 12.5\xa0?g/mL to 25\xa0?g/mL, there was an increase in cell inhibition up to 100%, which then reduced to 90% over the next three concentrations, 50\xa0?g/mL, 100\xa0?g/mL, and 200\xa0?g/mL, in HeLa cells; further inhibitory effects were observed in QBC-939 cells, from 9% inhibition at a concentration of 25\xa0?g/mL up to 37.96% inhibition at 100\xa0?g/mL concentration. Moreover, this is the first study to report the growth-promoting effects of this Echinacea blend in HUVEC, up to 800% at a dose concentration of 200\xa0?g/mL. Previous studies have suggested that chicoric acid of Echinacea spp. is responsible for the increased cell growth. The results of this study show that the hydroethanolic extract of Echinacea herbal medicine promotes the growth of HeLa cells and QBC-939 cancer cell proliferation, and may interfere with cancer treatment (i.e., chemotherapy drugs such as 5-fluorouracil and Cisplatin (DDP)). However, the Echinacea blend shows potential in neurodegenerative diseases with growth-promoting effects in HUVEC. Further animal trials (in vivo effect) measuring dose toxicology are necessary to demonstrate the interaction of this blend with body and tumor growth, and also any positive synergistic or adverse interaction with chemotherapeutic drugs listed, so as to confirm the current observation and epithelial tissue growth or regeneration in a neurodegenerative disease model.']	('Cichello', 'Simon Angelo')	Journal of traditional and complementary medicine	J Tradit Complement Med	['eng']

Forty-two head and neck cancer patients and 10 lung cancer patients participated in our clinical trial. Each patient received chemoradiotherapy for 4 weeks. In addition, each patient was treated with SMD-2 for 8 weeks, including 2 weeks prior to and after the chemoradiotherapy treatment. Comparison of urinary Cu, Zn, and Se levels and the ratios of Zn to Cu and Se to Cu at three time points in the two types of cancer were assessed using the generalized estimating equations (GEEs). After the patients received chemoradiotherapy for 4 weeks, SMD-2 treatment was found to be associated with a significant decrease in urinary Cu levels, whereas urinary Zn and Se levels increased significantly. In addition, the ratios of Zn to Cu and Se to Cu in the urine samples of these patients also increased significantly. Both the urinary Zn levels and the ratio of Zn to Cu in head and neck cancer patients were significantly higher than in lung cancer patients. Urinary Zn and Se levels and the ratios of Zn to Cu and Se to Cu, but not urinary Cu levels, increased significantly during and after treatment when assessed using the GEE model.

27110388	2015	12	Automatic assessment of average diaphragm motion trajectory from 4DCT images through machine learning.	"[""To automatically estimate average diaphragm motion trajectory (ADMT) based on four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT), facilitating clinical assessment of respiratory motion and motion variation and retrospective motion study. We have developed an effective motion extraction approach and a machine-learning-based algorithm to estimate the ADMT. Eleven patients with 22 sets of 4DCT images (4DCT1 at simulation and 4DCT2 at treatment) were studied. After automatically segmenting the lungs, the differential volume-per-slice (dVPS) curves of the left and right lungs were calculated as a function of slice number for each phase with respective to the full-exhalation. After 5-slice moving average was performed, the discrete cosine transform (DCT) was applied to analyze the dVPS curves in frequency domain. The dimensionality of the spectrum data was reduced by using several lowest frequency coefficients (fv) to account for most of the spectrum energy (?fv2). Multiple linear regression (MLR) method was then applied to determine the weights of these frequencies by fitting the ground truth-the measured ADMT, which are represented by three pivot points of the diaphragm on each side. The 'leave-one-out' cross validation method was employed to analyze the statistical performance of the prediction results in three image sets: 4DCT1, 4DCT2, and 4DCT1 + 4DCT2. Seven lowest frequencies in DCT domain were found to be sufficient to approximate the patient dVPS curves (R = 91%-96% in MLR fitting). The mean error in the predicted ADMT using leave-one-out method was 0.3 ± 1.9 mm for the left-side diaphragm and 0.0 ± 1.4 mm for the right-side diaphragm. The prediction error is lower in 4DCT2 than 4DCT1, and is the lowest in 4DCT1 and 4DCT2 combined. This frequency-analysis-based machine learning technique was employed to predict the ADMT automatically with an acceptable error (0.2 ± 1.6 mm). This volumetric approach is not affected by the presence of the lung tumors, providing an automatic robust tool to evaluate diaphragm motion.""]"	('Li', 'Guang')	Biomedical physics & engineering express	Biomed Phys Eng Express	['eng']

The galactose-coated magnetic glyconanoparticles could bind with lectins present in the cells and be isolated through magnet-mediated separation. Through Western blot and mass spectrometry, the arginine/serine rich splicing factor Sfrs1 was identified as a galactose-selective endogenous lectin, overexpressed in B16F10 cells, compared with B16F1 cells. In addition, galactin-3 was found in higher amounts in B16F10 cells. Finally, the glyconanoparticles exhibited a superior efficiency in lectin isolation, from both protein mixtures and live cells, than the corresponding more traditional microparticles functionalized with carbohydrates.

Objective\u2003Functional secretory tumors metastatic to the spine can secrete hormones, growth factors, peptides, and/or molecules into the systemic circulation that cause distinct syndromes, clinically symptomatic effects, and/or additional morbidity and mortality. En bloc resection has a limited role in metastatic spine disease due to the current paradigm that systemic burden usually determines morbidity and mortality. Our objective is to review the literature for studies focused on en bloc resection of functionally active spinal metastasis as the primary indication. Methods\u2003A review of the PubMed literature was performed to identify studies focused on functional secreting metastatic tumors to the spinal column. We identified five cases of patients undergoing en bloc resection of spinal metastases from functional secreting tumors. Results\u2003The primary histologies of these spinal metastases were pheochromocytoma, carcinoid tumor, choriocarcinoma, and a fibroblast growth factor 23-secreting phosphaturic mesenchymal tumor. Although studies of en bloc resection for these rare tumor subtypes are confined to case reports, this surgical treatment option resulted in metabolic cures and decreased clinical symptoms postoperatively for patients diagnosed with solitary functional secretory spinal metastasis. Conclusion\u2003Although the ability to formulate comprehensive conclusions is limited, case reports demonstrate that en bloc resection may be considered as a potential surgical option for the treatment of patients diagnosed with solitary functional secretory spinal metastatic tumors. Future prospective investigations into clinical outcomes should be conducted comparing intralesional resection and en bloc resection for patients diagnosed with solitary functional secretory spinal metastasis.']	('Goodwin', 'C Rory')	Global spine journal	Global Spine J	['eng']

['The Organisation of European Cancer Institutes (OECI) launched a program for accreditation and designation (A&D) of cancer centers in Europe based on voluntary participation in 2008. In 2012, the Italian Ministry of Health decided to fund cancer centers in Italy, members of the Alleanza Contro il Cancro (ACC), to go through the OECI accreditation program. Ten centers participated in the program and 10 completed the full cycle of the OECI A&D process in consecutive series over a 2-year period. The process was successfully completed within the planned timeline and the overall findings were presented to the Italian Ministry of Health and representatives of all the participating centers in November 2015. The program had a considerable team-building effect, which will likely continue as the improvement plans are implemented. Centers fed back to OECI that the A&D program had led to better formal organization of multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) and cancer care pathways, and had helped them to harmonize the integration of research into clinical practice. Centers also concluded that they benefited from recognition through an international accreditation system, and that it had led to them developing better patient information and involvement. The importance of the improvement plans that each center had to produce following the audit reviews cannot be underestimated. The OECI concludes that implementation of the A&D program at the national level is feasible despite national peculiarities related to health planning and organization in each member state. This is a good example of an EU project working well, with member states helping each other and learning from best practice, to improve the overall quality of cancer care and research and to establish consistency. The initial accreditation is the first part of an ongoing process of improving comprehensive cancer care, integrating bench to bedside.']	('Oberst', 'Simon')	Tumori	Tumori	['eng']

['Faced with the challenge of ensuring high-quality and cost-effective health systems in the context of persistent financial crisis, a global strategy for cancer prevention and treatment represents a priority for public health bodies and governments. The key goals for the initiative are to define standards of cancer prevention and care while leveraging the continuous progress of biomedical research in the interest of public health. In Italy, the establishment of a network of Comprehensive Cancer Centres (CCC) named the Alliance Against Cancer (ACC) is an important initiative taken by the Ministry of Health to foster common strategies for enhancing the quality of oncology research and care at the national level. The Istituto Superiore di Sanità (ISS) has played an important role in supporting ACC activities through a special national program called ISS for ACC, launched by the Italian Ministry of Health in 2006. A similar role has been pursued in subsequent initiatives, including ISS support for a project aimed at providing international accreditation of the CCC of the ACC, funded by the Italian Ministry of Health. The results of this initiative, reported in the current issue of Tumori, are especially significant since specific indicators of quality for research and cancer care have been successfully defined for all the participating institutes.

In 2012, IRST took part in the ministerial research project of the Organisation of European Cancer Institutes (OECI) accreditation program for Comprehensive Cancer Centers. The self-assessment period lasted 6\xa0months and was coordinated by a multidisciplinary project team headed by a project leader. Each project team member coordinated a subgroup whose task was to analyze specific standards from qualitative and quantitative questionnaires. During the self-assessment period for the areas in which IRST did not meet OECI requirements, the project team outlined several improvement plans. At the end of the self-assessment period, the OECI Accreditation & Designation Board approved the documentation presented by IRST and a peer review visit was scheduled. The OECI report suggested establishing a more specific and stronger centralized management and leadership of all the oncologic activities carried out in other centers. In accordance with these suggestions, IRST and the Local Health Authority of Romagna laid the foundations for a new management model for the Oncology Network of Romagna: the Comprehensive Cancer Care Network (CCCN).

Each model is not to be considered as an end but as a tool for improvement: e.g., mixing accreditation standards led to an improvement in the quality and safety of processes. The present article details the OECI accreditation experience of the European Institute of Oncology, in particular the following strengths of OECI standards: collaboration among several involved parties (patient, volunteer, patient's general practitioner) in the clinical and quality/safety processes; a larger involvement of support personnel (psycho-oncologists, dieticians, physical therapists); and the development of clinical/translational research and innovation in prevention, diagnosis, and treatment to guarantee the best available practice in diagnosis and treatment. The OECI accreditation is specific to oncology and therefore its standards are tailored to a cancer center, both in terms of language used in the standards manual and in terms of patient needs.

To address this challenge and identify peptides and non-chlorinated/chlorinated peptide DBPs from large sets of organic compounds in water, we developed a novel high throughput analysis strategy, which integrated multiple solid phase extraction (SPE), high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) separation, and non-target identification using precursor ion exclusion (PIE) high resolution mass spectrometry (MS). After MS analysis, structures of candidate compounds, particularly peptides, were obtained by searching against the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB). Using this strategy, we successfully detected 625 peptides (out of 17,205 putative compounds) and 617 peptides (out of 13,297) respectively in source and finished water samples.

They play a vital role in cellular signaling in both normal physiology and disease states, particularly cancer. Exosomes are powerful progenitors in altering target cell phenotypes, particularly in tumorigenesis and cancer progression, with the ability to alter tumor microenvironments and to assist in establishing the pre-metastatic niche. Many aspects of exosomes present them as novel means to identify cancer biomarkers for early detection and therapeutic targets, and using intrinsic and engineered characteristics of exosomes as therapeutic devices to ameliorate the progression of the disease. This review outlines some of the recent and major findings with regard to exosomes in cancer, and their utilization as therapeutic tools.']	('Munson', 'Phillip')	Medicines (Basel, Switzerland)	Medicines (Basel)	['eng']

27088048	2016	05	Redox-sensitive cross-linking enhances albumin nanoparticle function as delivery system for photodynamic cancer therapy.	['Photodynamic cancer therapy is still limited in its efficiency because of a lack of targeted methods avoiding non-specific toxicity. To overcome this we developed a system that is solely effective upon cellular uptake and intracellular activation by incorporating redox-sensitive chemistry. We used a nanoprecipitation method to obtain human serum albumin nanoparticles (HSA NP) with a diameter of 295 ± 5 nm and decorated them with the photosensitizer (PS) chlorin e6 (Ce6). The NP were stabilized using a redox-sensitive cross-linker to create a smart drug delivery system that is activated only upon NP disintegration in the reducing intracellular environment. Indeed, our drug delivery NP broke down in an environment emulating the reducing intracellular environment with 10 mM glutathione, but not under extracellular conditions. In contrast, the control cross-linked with glutaraldehyde did not break down in the reducing environment. Upon NP disintegration Ce6 fluorescence doubled as the result of diminished self-quenching. While the Ce6-HSA NP did not produce a significant amount of singlet oxygen upon irradiation, NP disintegration restored singlet oxygen production to about half of the value generated by the free Ce6. In vitro experiments with HeLa cells showed that the smart system was able to kill up to 81% of the cells while the glutaraldehyde cross-linked control only killed 56% of them at a drug concentration of 10 ng/ml. Also, Ce6 immobilization in HSA NP prevented dark toxicity in three different cell lines. For the first time, we demonstrate that it is possible to design a smart NP drug delivery system delivering a PS drug to cancer cells while avoiding toxicity prior to the uptake and irradiation. This finding may provide a means of designing more efficient PDT in cancer treatment.']	('Molina', 'Anna M')	Journal of nanomedicine & nanotechnology	J Nanomed Nanotechnol	['eng']

['We aimed to assess the risk factors for cost-related medication non-adherence (CRN) among older patients with cancer in the United States. We used data from the 2010 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) to assess risk factors for CRN including age, insurance coverage, nursing home residence, functional limitations, and frequency of hospitalization among old patients with cancer. CRN was self-reported. We conducted a multivariate regression analysis to assess the effect of each risk factor. 293 (9.9%) of 2,953 older patients (50+ years) cancer patients reported CRN. Those who reported CRN were more likely to be younger, women, African American, and Hispanics. Compared to those with Medicare, those with no health insurance coverage were 97% more likely to report CRN. High number in limitation in activities of daily living and hospitalization significantly increased risk for CRN. Sicker cancer patients were more likely to report CRN. Lack of health insurance may have prevented the cancer patients from receiving optimal care. Together, these results suggest that expanding insurance coverage and improving insurance benefit design for cancer patients is likely to decrease CRN and improve outcomes.']	('Zhang', 'James X')	Integrative cancer science and therapeutics	Integr Cancer Sci Ther	['eng']

27087886	2016	06	Posterior Contraction Rates of the Phylogenetic Indian Buffet Processes.	['By expressing prior distributions as general stochastic processes, nonparametric Bayesian methods provide a flexible way to incorporate prior knowledge and constrain the latent structure in statistical inference. The Indian buffet process (IBP) is such an example that can be used to define a prior distribution on infinite binary features, where the exchangeability among subjects is assumed. The phylogenetic Indian buffet process (pIBP), a derivative of IBP, enables the modeling of non-exchangeability among subjects through a stochastic process on a rooted tree, which is similar to that used in phylogenetics, to describe relationships among the subjects. In this paper, we study the theoretical properties of IBP and pIBP under a binary factor model. We establish the posterior contraction rates for both IBP and pIBP and substantiate the theoretical results through simulation studies. This is the first work addressing the frequentist property of the posterior behaviors of IBP and pIBP. We also demonstrated its practical usefulness by applying pIBP prior to a real data example arising in the field of cancer genomics where the exchangeability among subjects is violated.']	('Chen', 'Mengjie')	Bayesian analysis	Bayesian Anal	['eng']
27087837	2016	10	Principles of cooperation across systems: from human sharing to multicellularity and cancer.	['From cells to societies, several general principles arise again and again that facilitate cooperation and suppress conflict. In this study, I describe three general principles of cooperation and how they operate across systems including human sharing, cooperation in animal and insect societies and the massively large-scale cooperation that occurs in our multicellular bodies. The first principle is that of Walk Away: that cooperation is enhanced when individuals can leave uncooperative partners. The second principle is that resource sharing is often based on the need of the recipient (i.e., need-based transfers) rather than on strict account-keeping. And the last principle is that effective scaling up of cooperation requires increasingly sophisticated and costly cheater suppression mechanisms. By comparing how these principles operate across systems, we can better understand the constraints on cooperation. This can facilitate the discovery of novel ways to enhance cooperation and suppress cheating in its many forms, from social exploitation to cancer.']	('Aktipis', 'Athena')	Evolutionary applications	Evol Appl	['eng']

27084662	2016	12	Improving Outcomes for Esophageal Cancer using Proton Beam Therapy.	['Radiation therapy (RT) plays an essential role in the management of esophageal cancer. Because the esophagus is a centrally located thoracic structure there is a need to balance the delivery of appropriately high dose to the target while minimizing dose to nearby critical structures. Radiation dose received by these critical structures, especially the heart and lungs, may lead to clinically significant toxicities, including pneumonitis, pericarditis, and myocardial infarction. Although technological advancements in photon RT delivery like intensity modulated RT have decreased the risk of such toxicities, a growing body of evidence indicates that further risk reductions are achieved with proton beam therapy (PBT). Herein we review the published dosimetric and clinical PBT literature for esophageal cancer, including motion management considerations, the potential for reirradiation, radiation dose escalation, and ongoing esophageal PBT clinical trials.

"['Because it spares many normal tissues and reduces the integral dose, proton therapy (PT) is the preferred tumor irradiation technique for treating childhood cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic review of the clinical effectiveness of PT in children has been reported in the scientific literature. A systematic search for clinical outcome studies on PT published between 2007 and 2015 was performed in Medline (through OVID), EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library. Twenty-three primary studies were identified, including approximately 650 patients overall. The median/mean follow-up times were limited (range, 19-91 months). None of the studies were randomized, 2 were comparative, and 20 were retrospective. Most suffered from serious methodologic limitations, yielding a very low level of clinical evidence for the outcomes in all indications. For example, for retinoblastoma, very low-level evidence was found that PT might decrease the incidence of second malignancies. For chondrosarcoma, chordoma, craniopharyngioma, ependymoma, esthesioneuroblastoma, Ewing sarcoma, central nervous system germinoma, glioma, medulloblastoma, osteosarcoma, and rhabdomyosarcoma, there was insufficient evidence to either support or refute PT in children. For pelvic sarcoma (ie, nonrhabdomyosarcoma and non-Ewing sarcoma), pineal parenchymal tumor, primitive neuroectodermal tumor, and ""adult-type"" soft tissue sarcoma, no studies were identified that fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Although there is no doubt that PT reduces the radiation dose to normal tissues and organs, to date the critical clinical data on the long-term effectiveness and harm associated with the use of PT in the 15 pediatric cancers under investigation are lacking.

['In the United States, there has been a trend towards the increased utilization of bilateral mastectomy for the treatment of unilateral breast cancer. Yet, breast conserving surgery rates have increased slightly, so it is among women choosing mastectomy that the use of bilateral mastectomy is increasing. Ironically, since about 1985, the risk of developing contralateral breast cancer has decreased, likely due to the widespread use of adjuvant systemic therapy for the treatment of early breast cancer. The increased utilization of bilateral mastectomy is therefore puzzling, and this article discusses factors that may account for this trend. Several observational studies have shown that bilateral mastectomy is associated with improved survival when compared to unilateral mastectomy. However, these associations are probably due to selection bias, and bilateral mastectomy is unlikely to have an independent effect in improving survival for the majority of women with unilateral breast cancer. Bilateral mastectomy might be indicated for women with a high risk of developing contralateral breast cancer, such as those with a history of mantle irradiation or mutations in the BRCA 1 or BRCA 2 genes, but it cannot be entirely justified in the majority of women with unilateral breast cancer.']	('Jatoi', 'Ismail')	Indian journal of surgical oncology	Indian J Surg Oncol	['eng']

Diseases with known protein malfunctions may be mitigated through the use of siRNA therapeutics. The inhalation route of administration provides local delivery of siRNA therapeutics for the treatment of various pulmonary diseases, however barriers to pulmonary delivery and intracellular delivery of siRNA exists. siRNA loaded nanocarriers can be used to overcome the barriers associated with the pulmonary route, such as anatomical barriers, mucociliary clearance, and alveolar macrophage clearance. Apart from naked siRNA aerosol delivery, previously studied siRNA carrier systems comprise of lipidic, polymeric, peptide, or inorganic origin. Such siRNA delivery systems formulated as aerosols can be successfully delivered via an inhaler or nebulizer to the pulmonary region. Preclinical animal investigations of inhaled siRNA therapeutics rely on intratracheal and intranasal siRNA and siRNA nanocarrier delivery. Aerosolized siRNA delivery systems may be characterized using in vitro techniques, such as dissolution test, inertial cascade impaction, delivered dose uniformity assay, laser diffraction, and laser Doppler velocimetry. The ex vivo techniques used to characterize pulmonary administered formulations include the isolated perfused lung model. In vivo techniques like gamma scintigraphy, 3D SPECT, PET, MRI, fluorescence imaging and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamics analysis may be used for evaluation of aerosolized siRNA delivery systems. The use of inhalable siRNA delivery systems encounters barriers to their delivery, however overcoming the barriers while formulating a safe and effective delivery system will offer unique advances to the field of inhaled medicine.']	('Youngren-Ortiz', 'Susanne R')	Kona : powder science and technology in Japan	Kona	['eng']

Therefore, these studies indicate that an unsubstituted -NH2 moiety at the terminus of the thiosemicarbazone group should be avoided in the design of future compounds from this class.']	('Basha', 'Maram T')	Journal of inorganic biochemistry	J.

27077040	2015	09	Feasibility of a workflow for the molecular characterization of single cells by next generation sequencing.	"['The purpose of the study was to explore the feasibility of a protocol for the isolation and molecular characterization of single circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from cancer patients using a single-cell next generation sequencing (NGS) approach. To reach this goal we used as a model an artificial sample obtained by spiking a breast cancer cell line (MDA-MB-231) into the blood of a healthy donor. Tumor cells were enriched and enumerated by CellSearch(®) and subsequently isolated by DEPArray to obtain single or pooled pure samples to be submitted to the analysis of the mutational status of multiple genes involved in cancer. Upon whole genome amplification, samples were analysed by NGS on the Ion Torrent PGM system (Life Technologies) using the Ion AmpliSeq Cancer Hotspot Panel v2 (Life Technologies), designed to investigate genomic ""hot spot"" regions of 50 oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes. We successfully sequenced five single cells, a pool of 5 cells and DNA from a cellular pellet of the same cell line with a mean depth of the sequencing reaction ranging from 1581 to 3479 reads. We found 27 sequence variants in 18 genes, 15 of which already reported in the COSMIC or dbSNP databases. We confirmed the presence of two somatic mutations, in the BRAF and TP53 gene, which had been already reported for this cells line, but also found new mutations and single nucleotide polymorphisms. Three variants were common to all the analysed samples, while 18 were present only in a single cell suggesting a high heterogeneity within the same cell line. This paper presents an optimized workflow for the molecular characterization of multiple genes in single cells by NGS. The described pipeline can be easily transferred to the study of single CTCs from oncologic patients.']"	('Salvianti', 'Francesca')	Biomolecular detection and quantification	Biomol Detect Quantif	['eng']
27076918	2015	04	Bioactive lipid profiling reveals drug target engagement of a soluble epoxide hydrolase inhibitor in a murine model of tobacco smoke exposure.	['The inflammatory process underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) may be caused by tobacco smoke (TS) exposure. Previous studies show that epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) possess promising anti-inflammatory properties, therefore stabilization of EETs and other fatty acid epoxides through inhibition of soluble epoxide hydrolase (sEH) was investigated in mouse models of acute and sub-chronic inflammation caused by TS exposure. During the entire TS exposure, the potent sEH inhibitor 1-(1-methylsulfonyl-piperidin-4-yl)-3-(4-trifluoromethoxy-phenyl)-urea (TUPS) was given via drinking water. To assess drug target engagement of TUPS, a tandem mass spectrometry method was used for bioactive lipid profiling of a broad range of fatty acid metabolites, including EETs, and their corresponding diols (DHETs) derived from arachidonic acid, as well as epoxides and diols derived from other fatty acids. Several, but not all, plasma epoxide/diol ratios increased in mice treated with sEH inhibitor, compared to non-treated mice suggesting a wider role for sEH involving more fatty acid precursors besides arachidonic acid. This study supports qualitative use of epoxide/diol ratios explored by bioactive lipid profiling to indicate drug target engagement in mouse models of TS exposure relevant to COPD, which may have ramifications for future therapeutic interventions of sEH.']	('Nording', 'Malin L')	Journal of metabolomics	J Metabolomics	['eng']

Current treatment strategies include surgical resection, radiation, and chemotherapy. Doxorubicin has been widely used as a chemotherapeutic drug to treat osteosarcoma. However, drug resistance has become a challenge to its use. In this study, p53-wild type U2OS and p53-null MG-63 osteosarcoma-derived cells were used to investigate the mechanism of doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity. In cell viability assays, doxorubicin effectively induced apoptosis in U2OS cells via the p53 signaling pathway, evidenced by elevated PUMA and p21 protein levels and activated caspase 3 cleavage. In contrast, p53-null MG-63 cells were resistant to doxorubicin-induced apoptosis, while exogenous expression of p53 increased drug sensitivity in those cells. The role of TGF-?/Smad3 signaling was investigated by using TGF-? reporter luciferase assays. Doxorubicin was able to induce TGF-? signal transduction without increasing TGF-? production in the presence of p53. Knockdown of Smad3 expression by small hairpin RNA (shRNA) showed that Smad3 was required for p53-mediated TGF-? signaling in response to doxorubicin treatment in U2OS and MG-63 cells. Taken together, these data demonstrate that p53 and TGF-?/Smad3 signaling pathways are both essential for doxorubicin-induced cytotoxicity in osteosarcoma cells.']	('Sun', 'Yifu')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']
27073728	2016	12	Associations of intakes of magnesium and calcium and survival among women with breast cancer: results from Western New York Exposures and Breast Cancer (WEB) Study.	['Magnesium (Mg) and calcium (Ca) antagonizes each other in (re) absorption, cell cycle regulation, inflammation, and many other physiologic activities. However, few studies have investigated the association between magnesium and calcium intakes and breast cancer survival, and the interaction between calcium and magnesium intake. In a cohort of 1,170 women with primary, incident, and histologically confirmed breast cancer from Western New York State, we examined the relationship between intakes of these two minerals and survival. Cox regression models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI). Mean follow-up time was 87.4 months after breast cancer diagnosis; there were 170 deaths identified. After adjustment for known prognostic factors, and intakes of energy, total vitamin D and total calcium, higher dietary intake of magnesium was inversely associated with risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 0.50, 95% CI, 0.28-0.90 for highest vs. lowest tertile; p trend = 0.02). Likewise, a marginal association was found for total Magnesium intake from foods and supplements combined (HR = 0.58, 95% CI, 0.31-1.08; p trend = 0.09). The inverse association of higher total magnesium intake with all-cause mortality was primarily presented among postmenopausal women and was stronger among women who had a high Ca:Mg intake ratio (>2.59). There were no clear associations for prognosis with intake of calcium. We found that magnesium intake alone may improve overall survival following breast cancer, and the association may be stronger among those with high Ca:Mg intake ratio.']	('Tao', 'Meng-Hua')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

"[""This brief article focuses on two aims: i) To investigate the in vitro pharmaco-dynamic interactions of combining synthetic potent microtubule targeting anticancer agent, Fludelone (FD) with cyto-protective agent, Panaxytriol (PXT) derived from Panax ginseng, and ii) To illustrate step-by-step operation for conducting two-drug combination in vitro using the combination index method, in terms of experimental design, data acquisition, computerized simulation and data interpretation. The Chou-Talalay method for drug combination is based on the median-effect equation, which provides the theoretical basis for the combination index (CI)-isobologram equation that allows quantitative determination of drug interactions, where CI<1, =1, and >1 indicates synergism, additive effect and antagonism, respectively. Based on these algorithms, computer software, CompySyn, is used for determining synergism and antagonism at all doses or effect levels simulated automatically. The use of Chou-Talalay's CI method in quantifying synergism or antagonism is increasing steadily during the past two decades, however, confusing questions and pitfalls were still frequently raised by insufficient understanding of the theory, especially reflected when researchers trying to use the computerized software to design and conduct experiments. In order to specifically address the confusions and to illustrate the practical features of this method, in this paper, a selected example is given based on our unpublished data regarding the combinational pharmacologic interactions of FD and PXT against the growth of breast cancer cell line MX-1. The step-by-step operation from experimental design to the real data analysis is illustrated. The results indicated that FD and PXT combination in vitro exerted synergistic effect when cell growth inhibition was greater than 45%, with CI ranged 0.836-0.609 for the fractional inhibition of Fa=0.50~0.90, as shown by the Fa-CI plot and by the isobologram. Thus, quantitative conclusion of synergism is obtained using the Chou-Talalay CI method, under the well-defined simple conditions for the FD and PXT combinations in vitro.""]"	('Zhang', 'Ning')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

['CPA4 belongs to a member of the metallocarboxypeptidase family, and its expression in pancreatic cancer samples and clinical significance are still not investigated until now. In this study, we aimed to evaluate the level of CPA4 in pancreatic cancer samples and study its clinical implications as a diagnostic marker for pancreatic cancer. The levels of CPA4 in pancreatic cancer tissues and serum samples were measured by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. Among 150 pancreatic cancer tissues examined, 86.7% (130/150) of cases showed positive staining for CPA4. Clinicopathological relevance analysis showed that CPA4 expression was correlated with advanced clinical stage and lymph node metastasis. Also, we found that the levels of CPA4 in serum samples were significantly high in cases whose expression was also high in paired tissue samples (N=50). In a larger sample set, we found that serum CPA4 in pancreatic cancer patients was significantly higher than for healthy controls (P<0.05). In addition, high serum CPA4 was significantly associated with the TNM stage, Lymph node involvement and distant metastasis. At a cutoff value of 0.3 ng/ml, CPA4 might be a better diagnostic biomarker of pancreatic cancer than CA199. In conclusion, CPA4 overexpression is associated with pancreatic cancer progression, and it might be a potential diagnostic serum marker for pancreatic cancer.']	('Sun', 'Lichao')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

The patients in group A (n = 61) received HIFU in combination with S-1 and those in group B (n = 59) were given S-1 alone. S-1 was administered orally twice a day on days 1-14. Cycles were repeated every 21 days. The follow up time was 3~19 months in both groups. The median overall survival (OS) time and progression free survival (PFS) were analysed by Kaplan-Meier method and Logrank test. The pain remission rate of the two groups was compared by ?(2) test. Patient characteristics and prognostic factors were compared. Patient characteristics did not significantly differ between the 2 groups. Median OS was significantly longer in group A (10.3 months) than in group B (6.6 months, P = 0.000). Median PFS was also significantly longer in group A than in group B (5.1 months vs 2.3 months, P = 0.000). Meanwhile, the pain remission rate was markedly higher in group A than in group B (57% vs. 20%, P = 0.000). There were mild side effects and no significant difference was observed between the two groups. The treatment effect was independently associated with a good outcome.

27073724	2016	12	EGFR kinase-dependent and kinase-independent roles in clear cell renal cell carcinoma.	['Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is associated with progression of many epithelial malignancies and represents a significant therapeutic target. Although clear cell renal cell carcinoma (CCRCC) has been widely investigated for EGFR molecular alterations, genetic evidences of EGFR gene activating mutations and/or gene amplification have been rarely confirmed in the literature. Therefore, until now EGFR-targeted therapies in clinical trials have been demonstrated unsuccessful. New evidence has been given about the interactions between EGFR and the sodium glucose co-transporter-1 (SGLT1) in maintaining the glucose basal intracellular level to favour cancer cell growth and survival; thus a new functional role may be attributed to EGFR, regardless of its kinase activity. To define the role of EGFR in CCRCC an extensive investigation of genetic changes and functional kinase activities was performed in a series of tumors by analyzing the EGFR mutational status and expression profile, together with the protein expression of downstream signaling pathways members. Furthermore, we investigated the co-expression of EGFR and SGLT1 proteins and their relationships with clinic-pathological features in CCRCC. EGFR protein expression was identified in 98.4% of CCRCC. Furthermore, it was described for the first time that SGLT1 is overexpressed in CCRCC (80.9%), and that co-expression with EGFR is appreciable in 79.4% of the tumours. Moreover, the activation of downstream EGFR pathways was found in about 79.4% of SGLT1-positive CCRCCs. The mutational status analysis of EGFR failed to demonstrate mutations on exons 18 to 24 and the presence of EGFR-variantIII (EGFRvIII) in all CCRCCs analyzed. FISH analysis revealed absence of EGFR amplification, and high polysomy of chromosome 7. Finally, the EGFR gene expression profile showed gene overexpression in 38.2% of CCRCCs. Our study contributes to define the complexity of EGFR role in CCRCC, identifying its bivalent kinase-dependent and kinase-independent functions, both potentially involved in CCRCC progression. These results might have important implications on therapeutic approaches to CCRCC, since the disruption of the interaction between EGFR/SGLT1, mediated by anti-EGFR antibodies and/or SGLT1 inhibitors, might constitute a novel therapeutic target for CCRCC treatment, and new clinical trials should be evaluated on the basis of this therapeutic proposal.']	('Cossu-Rocca', 'Paolo')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

"[""Members of the human kallikrein-related peptidase (KLK) family, including KLK5, have been reported to play an important role in ovarian cancer progression. In the present study, we assessed KLK5 protein expression in ovarian cancer tissues by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and ELISA, and analyzed its association with clinicopathologic parameters and disease outcome in 95 patients with advanced ovarian cancer FIGO stage III/IV. KLK5 immunoexpression was evaluated in ovarian cancer tissue microarrays by IHC using a manual semiquantitative scoring system. KLK5 antigen levels were determined in ovarian cancer tumour tissue extracts by ELISA. KLK5 protein is expressed in ovarian cancer tissue by stromal and tumor cells. Mean KLK5 immunoscore values in tumor cells (KLK5-Tc; 5.7, range 0 to 12) were higher compared to stromal cells (KLK5-Sc; 1.2, range 0 to 9) but the correlation between KLK5-Tc and KLK5-Sc was rather low (rs = 0.34, P < 0.05). No significant associations of clinicopathological parameters with KLK5-Tc, KLK5-Sc, the combined overall score KLK5-Tc+Sc, or ELISA (KLK5-E) expression values were determined, except for KLK5-E protein expression with advanced age and high nuclear grade (G3). In univariate Cox regression analysis, elevated expression levels of KLK5-Sc are significantly linked with both prolonged overall survival (OS) (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.6, P = 0.046) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR = 0.54, P = 0.032) of advanced ovarian cancer patients. KLK5-Tc and KLK5-Tc+Sc scores as well as the KLK5-E values were not associated with patients' outcome. In multivariable analysis, KLK5-Sc expression was found to be statistically significant for PFS. Patients with elevated KLK5-Sc had a two-fold lower risk of disease recurrence (HR = 0.53, P = 0.037) as compared to patients with low KLK5-Sc. For KLK5-Sc and OS, a trend towards statistical significance was observed (HR = 0.62, P = 0.077).

27073721	2016	12	Elevated expression of flotillin-1 is associated with lymph node metastasis and poor prognosis in early-stage cervical cancer.	['Accumulating evidence has revealed that the expression of the lipid raft protein flotillin-1 is elevated in various human cancers, but the role flotillin-1 plays in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer remains unclear. The expression profile of flotillin-1 was assayed using real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemical (IHC) staining in cervical cancer cell lines and cancer tissues with paired adjacent noncancerous cervical tissues. The expression of flotillin-1 protein was detected by IHC staining in a large cohort of 308 paraffin-embedded cervical cancer tissues. Ectopic expression and the short hairpin RNA interference approach were employed to determine the role of flotillin-1 in cervical cancer cell metastasis and the possible mechanism involved. Flotillin-1 expression protein and mRNA were significantly upregulated in cervical cancer cell lines and cancer tissues; elevated expression of flotillin-1 protein in early-stage cervical cancer was significantly associated with pelvic lymph node metastasis (P < 0.001), and was an independent predictive factor of poor overall survival. Moreover, flotillin-1 up- and downregulation remarkably affected cervical cancer cell motility and invasion, respectively, through epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) regulated by the Wnt/?-catenin and nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) pathways. Our results suggest that flotillin-1 facilitates cervical cancer cell metastasis through Wnt/?-catenin and NF-?B pathway-regulated EMT and that the flotillin-1 expression profile serves not only as novel predictor of pelvic lymph node metastasis, but also as neoteric risk factor for patients with early-stage cervical cancer.']	('Li', 'Zheng')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']
27073720	2016	12	Verteporfin inhibits YAP function through up-regulating 14-3-3? sequestering YAP in the cytoplasm.	['Yes-associated protein (YAP), the central mediator of Hippo pathway, not only regulates a diversity of cellular processes during development but also plays a pivotal role in tumorigenesis. YAP is overexpressed in many types of human cancers with its expression level being associated with patient outcomes. Thus, inhibiting YAP function could provide a novel therapeutic approach. Verteporfin, a photosensitizer, which has been used in photodynamic therapy (PDT), was recently identified as an inhibitor of the interaction of YAP with TEAD, which, in turn, blocks transcriptional activation of targets downstream of YAP. However, the mechanism by which Verteporfin inhibits YAP activity remains to be elucidated. We demonstrate that overexpression of YAP stimulates cell proliferation whereas knocking down YAP or treating cells with Verteporfin inhibited cell proliferation, even in the presence of growth factors. Protoporphyrin IX, another photosensitizer, did not have similar activity demonstrating specificity to Verteporfin. Verteporfin induced sequestration of YAP in cytoplasm through increasing levels of 14-3-3?, a YAP chaperon protein that retains YAP in cytoplasm and targets it for degradation in the proteosome. Interestingly, while knockdown of YAP had no effect on the ability of Verteporfin to induce 14-3-3?, p53 is required for this effect of Verteporfin. This provides potential approaches to select patients likely to benefit from Verteporfin.']	('Wang', 'Chao')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

['The imprinted oncofetal long non-coding RNA H19 has been reported to be involved in many kinds of human cancers. However, whether lncRNA H19 implicate in oncogenesis and cancer progression in gallbladder cancer remain largely unknown. In the present study, compared with adjacent normal tissues, the level of H19 was significantly upregulated in gallbladder cancer tissues and was positively associated with lymphatic metastasis and tumor size. The overall survival is shorter in those who had higher H19 expression among GBC patients. In vitro, both TGF-?1 and IL-6 treatment induced upregulation of H19, downregulated the protein level of E-cadherin while increased Vimentin, indicating an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype in GBC. The overexpression of H19 in GBC cells enhanced tumor invasion and promoted EMT by upregulated transcription factor Twist1. On the contrary, Loss of function studies indicated that H19 interference in GBC suppressed tumor cell invasion and promoted mesenchymal-epithelial transition (MET) via suppressing Twist expression. In vivo, the volume of the tumors in H19-inteference group was significantly decreased compared to those in the control group of nude mice. Both western-blot and immunohistochemistry confirmed that a MET phenotype existed in the H19 interference group when compared to control group. These results defined H19 as a novel prognostic factor for GBC, and indicated that it might play important regulatory roles in the EMT process.']	('Wang', 'Shou-Hua')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']
27073718	2016	12	MicroRNA-373 promotes migration and invasion in human esophageal squamous cell carcinoma by inhibiting TIMP3 expression.	['Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the predominant pathological type of esophageal carcinoma in Asia. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of 19-22-nucleotide non-coding RNAs acting on target mRNAs that function as either oncogenes or anti-oncogenes. It has been confirmed that miR-373 expression varies among different tumor types. However, its mechanism is still unclear in ESCC. In our current study, we found that miR-373 expression was upregulated in ESCC tissues compared with matched adjacent normal tissues, as well as in the plasma of ESCC patients compared with that of healthy volunteers. Overexpression of miR-373 in ECA109 cells enhanced proliferation, G1-phase cell proportion, migration, and invasion. On the other hand, suppression of miR-373 in KYSE410 cells decreased proliferation, G1-phase cell proportion, migration, and invasion and also improved cell apoptosis. Moreover, we found that TIMP3, which was reported to suppress invasion and metastasis of ESCC, was a direct target of miR-373. Overexpression of miR-373 in ECA109 caused a reduction of TIMP3 mRNA and protein, whereas suppression of miR-373 in KYSE410 led to an increase of TIMP3 mRNA and protein. Introducing TIMP3 in miR-373 over-expressed cells or knocking down TIMP3 in miR-373 suppressed cells could partially abrogate the effect of miR-373 on migration and invasion. Therefore, these results prove that as an oncogene, miRNA-373 would be an important and reliable biomarker for ESCC diagnosis and treatment by targeting TIMP3.']	('Liu', 'Wenzhi')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

MRI represents the gold standard tool for differential diagnosis (with schwannoma, paraganglioma and haemangioma) and correct staging, while immunohistochemical and cytomorphologic analysis (bcl-2 and CD34 positivity in 90% of cases) is needed for definitive diagnosis. Surgery is the main treatment (endoscopic and open conservative technique), and its goal is a balance between safe oncological resection and good preservation of laryngeal functions; in this particular case an open laryngeal approach was scheduled due to the size of the tumour. Prognosis is good and in only a few cases (especially in pleural SFT) does the biological behaviour take a malignant course.']	('Grammatica', 'A')	Acta otorhinolaryngologica Italica : organo ufficiale della Societa italiana di otorinolaringologia e chirurgia cervico-facciale	Acta Otorhinolaryngol Ital	['eng']

The first 2- and 3-dimensional handheld multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) probes featuring real-time unmixing have recently been developed. Imaging performance of both probes was determined in vitro and in a brain melanoma metastasis mouse model in vivo. T1-weighted MR images were acquired for anatomical reference. The limit of detection of melanoma cells in vitro was significantly lower using the 2D than the 3D probe. The signal decrease was more profound in relation to depth with the 3D versus the 2D probe. Both approaches were capable of imaging the melanoma tumors qualitatively at all time points. Quantitatively, the 2D approach enabled closer anatomical resemblance of the tumor compared to the 3D probe, particularly at depths beyond 3\xa0mm.

27069325	2016	10	Exploring the Potential Role of Chemopreventive Agent, Hesperetin Conjugated Pegylated Gold Nanoparticles in Diethylnitrosamine-Induced Hepatocellular Carcinoma in Male Wistar Albino Rats.	['Liver cancer is the fifth most common cancer and is still one of the leading causes of death world wide, due to food additives, alcohol, fungal toxins, air, toxic industrial chemicals, and water pollutants. Chemopreventive drugs play a potential role in liver cancer treatment. Obviously in the production of anticancer drugs, the factors like poor solubility, bioavailability, biocompatibility, limited chemical stability, large amount of dose etc., plays a major role. Against this backdrop, the idea of designing the chemopreventive nature of bio flavanoid hesperetin (HP) drug conjugated with pegylated gold nanoparticles to increasing the solubility, improve bioavailability and enhance the targeting capabilities of the drug during diethylnitrosamine (DEN) induced liver cancer in male wistar albino rats. The dose fixation studies and the toxicity of pure HP and HP conjugated gold nanoparticles (Au-mPEG(5000)-S-HP) were analysed. After concluded the dose fixation and toxicity studies the experimental design were segregated in six groups for the anticancer analysis of DEN induced HCC for 16\xa0weeks. After the experimental period the body weight, relative liver weight, number of nodules and size of nodules, the levels of tumor markers like CEA, AFP and the level of lipid peroxidation, lipid hydroperoxides and the activities of antioxidant enzymes were assessed. The administration of DEN to rats resulted in increased relative liver weight and serum marker enzymes aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase, and gamma glutamyl transpeptidase. The levels of lipid peroxides elevated (in both serum and tissue) with subsequent decrease in the final body weight and tissue antioxidants like superoxide dismutase, catalase, reduced glutathione, glutathione peroxidise, and glutathione reductase. HP supplementation (20\xa0mg/kg b.wt) significantly attenuated these alterations, thereby showing potent anticancer effect in liver cancer and the HP loaded gold nanoparticels (Au-mPEG(5000)-S-HP) treated animals shows the better treatment than the pure HP due to the solubility of drug, bioavailability and the target drug delivery of the biodegradable polymer. Histological observations were also carried out, which added supports to the chemopreventive action of the pure HP and HP loaded gold nanoparticles (Au-mPEG(5000)-S-HP) against DEN induction during liver cancer progression. These findings suggest that HP loaded gold nanoparticels (Au-mPEG(5000)-S-HP) shows better efficacy than the pure HP against lipid peroxidation, hepatic cell damage and protects the antioxidant system in DEN induced hepatocellular carcinogenesis.']	('Gokuladhas', 'Krishnan')	Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB	Indian J Clin Biochem	['eng']
27069320	2016	06	Role of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Unfolded Protein Responses in Health and Diseases.	['Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is the site of protein synthesis, protein folding, maintainance of calcium homeostasis, synthesis of lipids and sterols. Genetic or environmental insults can alter its function generating ER stress. ER senses stress mainly by three stress sensor pathways, namely protein kinase R-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase-eukaryotic translation-initiation factor 2?, inositol-requiring enzyme 1?-X-box-binding protein 1 and activating transcription factor 6-CREBH, which induce unfolded protein responses (UPR) after the recognition of stress. Recent studies have demonstrated that ER stress and UPR signaling are involved in cancer, metabolic disorders, inflammatory diseases, osteoporosis and neurodegenerative diseases. However, the precise knowledge regarding involvement of ER stress in different disease processes is still debatable. Here we discuss the possible role of ER stress in various disorders on the basis of existing literature. An attempt has also been made to highlight the present knowledge of this field which may help to elucidate and conjure basic mechanisms and novel insights into disease processes which could assist in devising better future diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.']	('Mahdi', 'Abbas Ali')	Indian journal of clinical biochemistry : IJCB	Indian J Clin Biochem	['eng']

['Gynecologic and primary peritoneal serous carcinoma may be difficult to distinguish from abdominal mesotheliomas clinically, morphologically, and immunohistochemically. BAP1 double-hit inactivation and subsequent loss of protein expression have been reported in more than half of all abdominal mesotheliomas. We therefore sought to investigate the expression of BAP1 in serous carcinoma and explore its potential utility as a marker in the differential diagnosis with mesothelioma. We searched the computerized database of the Department of Anatomical Pathology, Royal North Shore Hospital, Australia, for all cases of gynecologic and peritoneal serous carcinomas and mesotheliomas diagnosed between 1998 and 2014. Immunohistochemistry for BAP1 was then performed on tissue microarray sections. Cases with completely absent nuclear staining in the presence of a positive internal control in nonneoplastic cells were considered negative. If staining was equivocal (eg, absent nuclear staining but no internal control), staining was repeated on whole sections. Loss of BAP1 expression was found in only 1 of 395 (0.3%) serous carcinomas but in 6 of 9 (67%) abdominal mesotheliomas (P < .001) and 131 of 277 (47%) thoracic mesotheliomas (P < .001). We conclude that BAP1 loss occurs extremely infrequently in gynecologic and peritoneal serous adenocarcinomas, whereas it is very common in mesotheliomas including abdominal mesothelioma. Therefore, although positive staining for BAP1 cannot be used to exclude a diagnosis of mesothelioma, loss of BAP1 expression can be used to very strongly support a pathological diagnosis of abdominal mesothelioma over serous carcinoma.']	('Andrici', 'Juliana')	Human pathology	Hum.

The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic value of OCT4 expression in PCa. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical records and evaluated the OCT4 expression in 205 patients with PCa who underwent radical prostatectomy. We examined the change of OCT4 expression in 3 patients with CRPC who underwent transurethral resection for local progression before and after docetaxel chemotherapy. OCT4 expression was significantly associated with higher pathological T stage (P < .001). The 5-year prostate-specific antigen recurrence-free survival rate was 56.8% in patients with higher OCT4 expression and 90.6% in patients with lower OCT4 expression (P < .001). Multivariate analysis revealed that high OCT4 expression was an independent prognostic indicator of prostate-specific antigen recurrence (P < .001). Elevated strong OCT4 expression in residual CRPC cells after docetaxel chemotherapy was observed in all CRPC patients, compared with before chemotherapy in corresponding specimens. Higher OCT4 expression represents a clinically relevant predictor of patient prognosis in PCa and may be a new biomarker that will provide additional prognostic information in CRPC when treated with docetaxel.']	('Kosaka', 'Takeo')	Human pathology	Hum.

More than 180 causative variants in the PARKIN gene have been identified; point mutations and copy number variants (i.e., exon deletions or duplications) occur at nearly equal frequencies.(1) PARKIN is one of the largest genes in the human genome (1.3 Mb) and contains a chromosomal fragile site (CFS) FRA6E (6q26) between exons 2 and 8. This is of interest regarding the etiology of cancer because CFSs are prone to spontaneous breaks leading to chromosome alterations. Therefore, it is not surprising that PARKIN mutations have also been found in various cancer cell lines and primary tumors.(2,3) Mutations in PARKIN show decreased PARKIN E3 ligase function with resultant accumulation of cyclin E, creating the potential for mitotic instability in dividing cells.']"	('Schüle', 'Birgitt')	Neurology.

"[""trans-Cyanocombretastatin A-4 (trans-CA-4) analogues have been structurally modified to afford their more stable CA-4-(2H)-1,2,3-triazole analogues. Fifteen novel, stable 4-heteroaryl-5-aryl-(2H)-1,2,3-triazole CA-4 analogues (8a-i, 9 and 11a-e) were evaluated for anti-cancer activity against a panel of 60 human cancer cell lines. These analogues displayed potent cytotoxic activity against both hematological and solid tumor cell lines with GI50 values in the low nanomolar range. The most potent compound, 8a, was a benzothiophen-2-yl analogue that incorporated a 3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl moiety connected to the (2H)-1,2,3-triazole ring system. Compound 8a exhibited GI50 values of <10 nM against 80% of the cancer cell lines in the panel. Three triazole analogues, 8a, 8b and 8g, showed particularly potent growth inhibition against the triple negative Hs578T breast cancer cell line with GI50 values of 10.3 nM, 66.5 nM and 20.3 nM, respectively. Molecular docking studies suggest that these compounds bind to the same hydrophobic pocket at the interface of ?- and ?-tubulin that is occupied by colchicine and cis-CA-4, and are stabilized by Van der Waals' interactions with surrounding amino acid residues. Compound 8a was found to inhibit tubulin polymerization in vitro with an IC50 value of 1.7 µM.

['Pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP) is the intra-peritoneal accumulation of mucus due to mucinous neoplasia, most often from a ruptured mucinous appendiceal neoplasm. A similar syndrome is caused by appendix cancer and other gastrointestinal malignancies. Cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy (HIPEC) provides long-term survival in selected patients with these conditions. The management of the appendiceal neoplasm prior to development of peritoneal involvement is initially discussed. This is followed by an overview of the management of peritoneal disease caused by appendiceal neoplasms. The principles and basic techniques of CRS and intraperitoneal chemotherapy (both intraoperative and post operative) are then discussed. Survival outcomes from several large studies are summarised. Prognostic factors are also discussed. We report our basic outcome data for the 345 patients with PMP or appendix cancer treated at our institution. Finally, the promising upcoming treatment of mucolytic therapy is discussed. We conclude that appendiceal neoplasms, although rare can cause significant morbidity and mortality. With optimal management long-term survival is possible in the majority of patients. The key to treatment is complete cytoreduction and use of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy.']	('Lansom', 'Joshua')	Indian journal of surgical oncology	Indian J Surg Oncol	['eng']

Curative surgery offers the only chance of cure, but most of patients present with unresectable or metastatic disease and are candidates for palliative treatment only. This study was designed to evaluate efficacy of chemotherapy over best supportive care in unresectable/metastatic GBC. Patients with unresectable/metastatic GBC with proven tissue diagnosis were enrolled for single institution non-randomized prospective cohort study between May 2012 and April 2014. A total of 65 patients received palliative chemotherapy; either combination chemotherapy (n\u2009=\u200959) or single agent chemotherapy (n\u2009=\u20096). Combination chemotherapy regimen were either three weekly Gemcitabine-Cisplatin (n\u2009=\u200945) or Gemcitabine-Oxaliplatin (n\u2009=\u200914) for a maximum of six cycles. Twenty patients, either unfit for chemotherapy or unwilling for the same were advised best supportive care (BSC). The overall response rate to chemotherapy was 34\xa0%. Median survival for chemotherapy group and BSC group were 35.6 and 13\xa0weeks, respectively (p value\u2009<\u20090.001).

The primary end point was resection rate of liver metastases, which was evaluated in all patients. Secondary end points were response rate according to Response evaluation criteria in solid tumors (RECIST) criteria, perioperative morbidity and mortality. An objective response was observed in 28 (60.9\xa0%) patients. Seven (15.2\xa0%) patients were reported radiologically to have a complete response (CR); 21 (45.7\xa0%) patients had radiological partial response (PR).

Microscopically complete resections (R0 resection) was performed in all 28 patients (60.9\xa0%). The most frequent toxicities were skin rash and diarrhoea. There was no operative mortality. Chemotherapy with cetuximab yields high response rates compared with historical controls, and leads to significantly increased resectability. Complete resection of previously unresectable colorectal liver metastases can be performed with minimal morbidity and mortality. This therapeutic strategy involves a multimodal approach.']	('Somashekhar', 'S P')	Indian journal of surgical oncology	Indian J Surg Oncol	['eng']

The aim of this study is to address the patterns of external breast prosthesis used in India and view of Indian women on such prosthesis after mastectomy for breast cancer. This was a descriptive longitudinal study. In this study we interviewed (telephonic) 63 people, after three years of completing treatment under The Department of Surgical Oncology, St. Johns medical college, Bangalore. Among the study group, 27 members (40\xa0%) were using various prosthesis, rest 36 women were not using any type of prosthesis. Among the users of prosthesis, silicon prosthesis was used by 6 women, padded cups by 8 women, cloth or cotton by 12 women and 1 woman used other type of prosthesis. Most women use simple items like cloth and cotton (44\xa0%). Next most commonly used prosthesis are padded cups(). Only 22\xa0% of women were found using silicon prosthesis in this study. Most of the well educated patients used external prosthesis either in the form of silicon prosthesis or padded cups. Most of women below age of 50 used external breast prosthesis. Use of prosthesis was more in urban compared to rural population (48\xa0% vs 25\xa0%). Prosthesis users worried more about the body image than women not using prosthesis. 25\xa0% of women using prosthesis had body image issues where as only 5\xa0% of non prosthesis users had such problems. Prosthesis users need improvement in terms of comfort, size, shape and affordability. Most common reasons for not using prosthesis are age, lack of motivation and awareness. Less than half of the women included in this study used external prosthesis after mastectomy for breast cancer. Most of the women are used home made prosthesis like cloth and cotton (44.4\xa0%). Education, age and urban status are the strong factors which influences use of prosthesis. Prosthesis users are those who are more concerned about their body image. There is a palpable need to develop better prosthesis at affordable price.']	('Ramu', 'D')	Indian journal of surgical oncology	Indian J Surg Oncol	['eng']

['Axillary staging is one of the primary steps in management of Breast cancer patients. Current standard methods including blue dye and radicolloid have limitations and disadvantages. In this study, the feasibility of visualization of lymph node pathways and localization of SLN with the help of CEUS was assessed. 50 patients with early breast cancer diagnosis underwent CEUS and wire localization, methylenblue dye, and isotope scan methods for SLN detection. The pathology findings of the wired SLN were compared with those obtained from, methylenblue dye, and isotope scan methods. Lymph node wiring was successfully performed in 48 patients.Radio-isotope technique detected SLN in all 50 patients while blue-dye succeeded in 48. Sensitivity of CEUS to detect SLN compared with radio-isotope and blue dye methods was 96\xa0% and 100\xa0%, respectively. Considering costs and facilities required to perform radio-isotope technique and complications of blue dye we may accept CEUS with the help of micro-bubble contrasts as a viable alternative.

"['Breast Cancer (BC) treatment leads to mutilation and destruction of breast shape with negative effects on body image and self-esteem.One of the main goals of reconstructive and oncoplastic breast surgery is to satisfy patients and improve their quality of life (QoL).Therefore, it is important to assess the patient experience post-surgery by means of patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) that focus on the patient\'s perception of the surgery and surgical care, as well as psychosocial well-being and physical functioning. The objective of the current study was to identify predictors of patient satisfaction such as breast appearance including implant type in a selective sample of women who underwent breast reconstruction surgery using implants. Participants in this prospective study were women, (age 26-75\xa0years) that were newly diagnosed with breast carcinoma. All consecutive patients who underwent breast reconstruction between January 2013 and October 2014 were asked to complete the BREAST-Q questionnaire 1\xa0year after surgery. 120 patients underwent unilateral breast reconstruction using implant. While 38 patients underwent reconstruction with opposite breast reduction symmertization, 27 patients underwent therapeutic mammoplasty. The response rate for BREAST-Q questionnaire completion was 98\xa0% with 147 out of 150 study participants completed the questionnaire. From the data collected from 147 patients, the responses could be distributed into 4 distinct groups based on the reconstruction outcomes namely ""very much satisfied"" (93\xa0%) or ""definitely and mostly satisfied"" (94\xa0%) or ""satisfied"" with the outcome (88\xa0%) or ""definitely agree on having reconstruction rather than the alternative of having no breast ""(91\xa0%).The results showed significant improvement in all four areas that were evaluated after surgery namely satisfaction with the appearance of the breasts, psychosocial, sexual and physical well-being. While the reconstruction surgery had an overall positive impact on quality of life it was observed that in patients that did not undergo breast reconstruction psychological issues related to sexuality were observed. Many newly diagnosed BC patients do not opt for these new surgical procedures due to psychological trauma or lack of information. Based on these observations, we propose that Breast Cancer Management protocols should also include additional counselling support for the newly diagnosed BC patients on the option of breast reconstruction along with conventional medical treatment counselling by the Oncosurgeon.']"	('Shekhawat', 'Laxmi')	Indian journal of surgical oncology	Indian J Surg Oncol	['eng']

27065658	2015	12	Factors Influencing Non-sentinel Node Involvement in Sentinel Node Positive Patients and Validation of MSKCC Nomogram in Indian Breast Cancer Population.	['Current guidelines recommend completion axillary lymphnode dissection (ALND) when sentinel lymphnode (SLN) contains metastatic tumor deposit. In consequent ALND sentinel node is the only node involved by tumor in 40-70\xa0% of cases. Recent studies demonstrate the oncologic safety of omitting completion ALND in low risk patients. Several nomograms (MSKCC, Stanford, MD Anderson score, Tenon score) had been developed in predicting the likelihood of additional nodes metastatic involvement. We evaluated accuracy of MSKCC nomogram and other clinicopathologic variables associated with additional lymph node metastasis in our patients. A total of 334 patients with primary breast cancer patients underwent SLN biopsy during the period Jan 2007 to June 2014. Clinicopathologic variables were prospectively collected. Completion ALND was done in 64 patients who had tumor deposit in SLN. The discriminatory accuracy of nomogram was analyzed using Area under Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). SLN was the only node involved with tumor in 69\xa0% (44/64) of our patients. Additional lymph node metastasis was seen in 31\xa0% (20/64). On univariate analysis, extracapsular infiltration in sentinel node and multiple sentinel nodes positivity were significantly associated (p\xa0<\xa00.05) with additional lymph node metastasis in the axilla. Area under ROC curve for nomogram was 0.58 suggesting poor performance of the nomogram in predicting NSLN involvement. Sentinel nodes are the only nodes to be involved by tumor in 70\xa0% of the patients. Our findings indicate that multiple sentinel node positivity and extra-capsular invasion in sentinel node significantly predicted the likelihood of additional nodal metastasis. MSKCC nomogram did not reliably predict the involvement of additional nodal metastasis in our study population.']	('Padmanabhan', 'Naveen')	Indian journal of surgical oncology	Indian J Surg Oncol	['eng']
27065657	2015	07	Utility of [18F] Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (FDG PET/CT) in the Initial Staging and Response Assessment of Locally Advanced Breast Cancer Patients Receiving Neoadjuvant Chemotherapy.	['In India up to 50\xa0% of breast cancer patients still present as locally advanced breast cancer (LABC).

It is likely that the conventional staging underestimates the extent of initial spread and there is a need for more sophisticated staging procedure. The PET/CT can detect extra-axillary and occult distant metastases and also aid in predicting response to chemotherapy at an early point in time. To evaluate the utility of FDG PET/CT in initial staging and response assessment of patients with LABC receiving NACT. A prospective study of all biopsy confirmed female patients diagnosed with LABC receiving NACT from April 2013 to May 2014. The conventional work up included serum chemistry, CECT chest and abdomen and bone scan. A baseline whole body PET/CT was done in all patients. A repeat staging evaluation and a whole body PET/CT was done after 2/3rd cycle of NACT in non-responders and after 3/4\xa0cycles in clinical responders. The histopathology report of the operative specimen was used to document the pathological response. The FDG PET/CT reported distant metastases in 11 of 38 patients, where as conventional imaging revealed metastases in only 6. Almost all the\xa0distant lesions detected by conventional imaging were detected with PET/CT, which showed additional sites of metastasis in 3 patients. In 2 patients, PET/CT detected osteolytic bone metastasis which were not detected by bone scan. In 5 patients PET CT detected N3 disease which were missed on conventional imaging. A total of 14 patients had second PET/CT done to assess the response to NACT and 11 patients underwent surgery. Two patients had complete pathological response. Of these 1 patient had complete metabolic and morphologic response and other had complete metabolic and partial morphologic response on second PET/CT scan.

['Molecular balance between Angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1) and Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) has important effects in tumor angiogenesis. Ang-2 was shown to be elevated and proved to be a prognostic factor in acute myeloid leukemia (AML). To date studies revealed increased angiogenesis in bone marrows (BMs) of both myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and AML patients. We conducted this study to demonstrate circulating levels of Ang-1 and Ang-2 in MPN patients since no data exists in literature. Thirty-three newly diagnosed MPN, 27 newly diagnosed AML patients and 25 controls (HC) were enrolled and Angiopoietin levels were determined with ELISA. We found that Ang-1 levels were higher whereas Ang-2 levels were lower in MPN and HC when compared to AML. Our results suggest that though angiogenesis is increased in both AML and MPN, angiopoietin serum level profile of the two diseases are different, and MPN patients have similar Ang-1 and Ang-2 levels as HC. We conclude that, according to our results Ang-1 and Ang-2 do not only regulate tumor angiogenesis and the difference between angiopoietin levels of acute and chronic myeloid neoplasms could be a reflection of other effects of these growth factors on tumor malignancy.']	('Atesoglu', 'Elif Birtas')	Indian journal of hematology & blood transfusion : an official journal of Indian Society of Hematology and Blood Transfusion	Indian J Hematol Blood Transfus	['eng']

['Dendritic cell (DC)-based immunotherapy has yielded promising results against high-grade glioma (HGG). However, the efficacy of DC vaccines is abated by HGG-induced immunosuppression and lack of attention toward the immunogenicity of the tumor lysate/cells used for pulsing DCs. A literature analysis of DC vaccination clinical trials in HGG patients delineated the following two most predominantly applied methods for tumor lysate preparation: freeze-thaw (FT)-induced necrosis or FT-necrosis followed by X-ray irradiation. However, from the available clinical evidence, it is unclear which of both methodologies has superior immunogenic potential. Using an orthotopic HGG murine model (GL261-C57BL/6), we observed that prophylactic vaccination with DCs pulsed with irradiated FT-necrotic cells (compared to FT-necrotic cells only) prolonged overall survival by increasing tumor rejection in glioma-challenged mice. This was associated, both in prophylactic and curative vaccination setups, with an increase in brain-infiltrating Th1 cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), paralleled by a reduced accumulation of regulatory T cells, tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) and myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC). Further analysis showed that irradiation treatment of FT-necrotic cells considerably increased the levels of carbonylated proteins - a surrogate-marker of oxidation-associated molecular patterns (OAMPs). Through further application of antioxidants and hydrogen peroxide, we found a striking correlation between the amount of lysate-associated protein carbonylation/OAMPs and DC vaccine-mediated tumor rejection capacity thereby suggesting for the first time a role for protein carbonylation/OAMPs in at least partially mediating antitumor immunity. Together, these data strongly advocate the use of protein oxidation-inducing modalities like irradiation for increasing the immunogenicity of tumor lysate/cells used for pulsing DC vaccines.']	('Vandenberk', 'Lien')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Mesothelioma is an almost invariably fatal tumor with chemotherapy extending survival by a few months. One immunotherapeutic strategy is to target dendritic cells (DCs), key antigen-presenting cells involved in antigen presentation, to induce antigen-specific T cell responses. However, DC-targeting will only be effective if DCs are fit-for-purpose, and the functional status of DCs in mesothelioma patients was not clear. We found that mesothelioma patients have significantly decreased numbers of circulating myeloid (m)DC1 cells, mDC2 cells and plasmacytoid (p)DCs relative to healthy age and gender-matched controls. Blood monocytes from patients could not differentiate into immature monocyte-derived DCs (MoDCs), indicated by a significantly reduced ability to process antigen and reduced expression of costimulatory (CD40, CD80 and CD86) and MHC (HLA-DR) molecules, relative to controls. Activation of mesothelioma-derived MoDCs with LPS+/-IFN? generated partially mature MoDCs, evident by limited upregulation of the maturation marker, CD83, and the costimulatory markers. Attempts to rescue mesothelioma-derived DC function using CD40Ligand(L) also failed, indicated by maintenance of antigen-processing capacity and limited upregulation of CD40, CD83, CD86 and HLA-DR. These data suggest that mesothelioma patients have significant numerical and functional DC defects and that their reduced capacity to process antigen and reduced expression of costimulatory molecules could induce anergized/tolerized T cells. Nonetheless, survival analyses revealed that individuals with mesothelioma and higher than median levels of mDC1s and/or whose MoDCs matured in response to LPS, IFN? or CD40L lived longer, implying their selection for DC-targeting therapy could be promising especially if combined with another treatment modality.']	('Cornwall', 'Scott M J')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

27057462	2016	08	Flagellin is a strong vaginal adjuvant of a therapeutic vaccine for genital cancer.	['Cervical cancer is a high-incidence female cancer most commonly caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection of the genital mucosa. Immunotherapy targeting HPV-derived tumor antigens (TAs) has been widely studied in animal models and in patients. Because the female genital tract is a portal for the entry of HPV and a highly compartmentalized system, the development of topical vaginal immunotherapy in an orthotopic cancer model would provide an ideal therapeutic. Thus, we examined whether flagellin, a potent mucosal immunomodulator, could be used as an adjuvant for a topical therapeutic vaccine for female genital cancer. Intravaginal (IVAG) co-administration of the E6/E7 peptides with flagellin resulted in tumor suppression and long-term survival of tumor-bearing mice. In contrast to IVAG vaccination, intranasal (IN) or subcutaneous (SC) immunization did not induce significant tumor suppression in the same model. The vaginal adjuvant effect of the flagellin was completely abolished in Toll-like receptor-5 (TLR5) knock-out mice. IVAG immunization with the E6/E7 peptides plus flagellin induced the accumulation of CD4+ and CD8+ cells and the expression of T cell activation-related genes in the draining genital lymph nodes (gLNs). The co-administered flagellin elicited antigen-specific IFN? production in the gLNs and spleen. The intravaginally administered flagellin was found in association with CD11c+ cells in the gLNs. Moreover, after immunization with a flagellin and the E6/E7 peptides, the TLR5 expression in gLN cells was significantly upregulated. These results suggest that flagellin serves as a potent vaginal adjuvant for a therapeutic peptide cancer vaccine through the activation of TLR5 signaling.']	('Lee', 'Shee Eun')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

Recent data show that a similar mechanism can also operate in IFN?-mediated anticancer control.

27057460	2016	10	Oncolytic virotherapy with an armed vaccinia virus in an orthotopic model of renal carcinoma is associated with modification of the tumor microenvironment.	['Oncolytic virotherapy is an emergent promising therapeutic approach for the treatment of cancer. We have constructed a vaccinia virus (WR strain) deleted for thymidine kinase (TK) and ribonucleotide reductase (RR) genes that expressed the fusion suicide gene FCU1 derived from the yeast cytosine deaminase and uracil phosphoribosyltransferase genes. We evaluated this construct (VV-FCU1) in the orthotopic model of renal carcinoma (RenCa). Systemic administration of VV-FCU1 resulted in orthotopic tumor growth inhibition, despite temporary expression of viral proteins. VV-FCU1 treatment was associated with an infiltration of tumors by CD8+ T lymphocytes and a decrease in the proportion of infiltrating Tregs, thus modifying the ratio of CD8+/CD4+ Treg in favor of CD8+cytotoxic T cells. We demonstrated that VV-FCU1 treatment prolonged survival of animals implanted with RenCa cells in kidney. Depletion of CD8+ T cells abolished the therapeutic effect of VV-FCU1 while depletion of CD4+ T cells enhanced its protective activity. Administration of the prodrug 5-fluorocytosine (5-FC) resulted in a sustained control of tumor growth but did not extend survival. This study shows the importance of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in vaccinia virus-mediated oncolytic virotherapy and suggests that this approach may be evaluated for the treatment of human renal cell carcinoma.']	('Fend', 'Laetitia')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

27057453	2016	08	Oncolytic virotherapy for treatment of breast cancer, including triple-negative breast cancer.	['Breast cancer is a heterogeneous disease, characterized by several distinct biological subtypes, among which triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is one associated with a poor prognosis. Oncolytic virus replication is an immunogenic phenomenon, and viruses can be armed with immunostimulatory molecules to boost virus triggered antitumoral immune responses. Cyclophosphamide (CP) is a chemotherapy drug that is associated with cytotoxicity and immunosuppression at higher doses, whereas immunostimulatory and anti-angiogenic properties are observed at low continuous dosage. Therefore, the combination of oncolytic immuno-virotherapy with low-dose CP is an appealing approach. We investigated the potency of oncolytic adenovirus Ad5/3-D24-GMCSF on a TNBC cell line and in vivo in an orthotopic xenograft mouse model, in combination with low-dose CP or its main active metabolite 4-hydroperoxycyclophosphamide (4-HP-CP). Furthermore, we summarized the breast cancer-specific human data on this virus from the Advanced Therapy Access Program (ATAP). Low-dose CP increased the efficacy of Ad5/3-D24-GMCSF in vitro and in a TNBC mouse model. In ATAP, treatments appeared safe and well-tolerated. Thirteen out of 16 breast cancer patients treated were evaluable for possible benefits with modified RECIST 1.1 criteria: 1 patient had a minor response, 2 had stable disease (SD), and 10 had progressive disease (PD). One patient is alive at 1,771\xa0d after treatment. Ad5/3-D24-GMCSF in combination with low-dose CP showed promising efficacy in preclinical studies and possible antitumor activity in breast cancer patients refractory to other forms of therapy. This preliminary data supports continuing the clinical development of oncolytic adenoviruses for treatment of breast cancer, including TNBC.']	('Bramante', 'Simona')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN/CD147) mediates tumor cell-macrophage interactions, and has been shown to induce both matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). However, the epitope responsible for MMP induction is controversial, and the epitope responsible for VEGF induction is yet unknown. We generated a novel anti-EMMPRIN antibody directed against a specific epitope that successfully inhibited the production of both MMP-9 and VEGF in tumor cell-macrophage in vitro co-culture systems, exhibiting a U-shaped dose response. Furthermore, this antibody efficiently inhibited in vivo tumor progression in both the RENCA renal cell carcinoma and CT26 colon carcinoma subcutaneous tumor models, and reduced tumor size and number of metastatic foci in the 4T1 orthotopic model. This was achieved by inhibiting angiogenesis as assessed by immunohistochemical staining for the endothelial marker CD31, by inhibiting tumor cell proliferation as assessed by the staining for Ki-67, and by enhancing tumor cell apoptosis as assessed in the TUNEL assay. Moreover, administration of the antibody recruited more macrophages into the tumor, and skewed the tumor microenvironment for macrophages from TGF?-dominated anti-inflammatory microenvironment, to a less immunosuppressive one. The antibody improved the ability of stimulated macrophages to perform antibody-dependent cell cytotoxicity (ADCC) and kill tumor cells. Thus, our new antibody maps the epitope capable of inducing both MMPs and VEGF, and places EMMPRIN as a good target for cancer therapy.']	('Walter', 'Miriam')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

The current study aims to investigate the potential of FPR1 to regulate human hepatoma growth and invasion. We found the FPR1 gene and protein expression in human intratumoral and peritumoral tissues of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) specimens and in human hepatoma cell lines. FPR1 activation mediated the migration, calcium mobilization and ERK-dependent IL-8 production by hepatic cancer cells. FPR1 knockdown substantially reduced the tumorigenicity of hepatoma cells in nude mice. Necrotic hepatic tumor cells released factor(s) that activated FPR1 in live tumor cells.

27057447	2016	11	Low density of FOXP3-positive T cells in normal colonic mucosa is related to the presence of beta2-microglobulin mutations in Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancer.	['Microsatellite instability (MSI-H) is caused by DNA mismatch repair deficiency and occurs in 15% of colorectal cancers. MSI-H cancers generate highly immunogenic frameshift peptide (FSP) antigens, which elicit pronounced local immune responses. A subset of MSI-H colorectal cancers develops in frame of Lynch syndrome, which represents an ideal human model for studying the concept of immunoediting. Immunoediting describes how continuous anti-tumoral immune surveillance of the host eventually leads to the selection of tumor cells that escape immune cell recognition and destruction. Between 30 and 40% of Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancers display loss of HLA class I antigen expression as a result of Beta2-microglobulin (B2M) mutations. Whether B2M mutations result from immunoediting has been unknown. To address this question, we related B2M mutation status of Lynch syndrome-associated colorectal cancer specimens (n\xa0=\xa030) to CD3-positive, CD8-positive and FOXP3-positive T cell infiltration in both tumor and normal mucosa. No significant correlation between B2M mutations and immune cell infiltration was observed in tumor tissue. However, FOXP3-positive T cell infiltration was significantly lower in normal mucosa adjacent to B2M-mutant (mt) compared to B2M-wild type (wt) tumors (mean: 0.98% FOXP3-positive area/region of interest (ROI) in B2M-wt vs. 0.52% FOXP3-positive area/ROI in B2M-mt, p\xa0=\xa00.023). Our results suggest that in the absence of immune-suppressive regulatory T cells (Treg), the outgrowth of less immunogenic B2M-mt tumor cells is favored. This finding supports the immunoediting concept in human solid cancer development and indicates a critical role of the immune milieu in normal colonic mucosa for the course of disease.']	('Echterdiek', 'Fabian')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27057446	2016	08	Repeated PD-1/PD-L1 monoclonal antibody administration induces fatal xenogeneic hypersensitivity reactions in a murine model of breast cancer.	['Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) targeting coinhibitory molecules such as PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4 are increasingly used as targets of therapeutic intervention against cancer. While these targets have led to a critical paradigm shift in treatments for cancer, these approaches are also plagued with limitations owing to cancer immune evasion mechanisms and adverse toxicities associated with continuous treatment. It has been difficult to reproduce and develop interventions to these limitations preclinically due to poor reagent efficacy and reagent xenogenecity not seen in human trials. In this study, we investigated adverse effects of repeated administration of PD-1 and PD-L1 mAbs in the murine 4T1 mammary carcinoma model. We observed rapid and fatal hypersensitivity reactions in tumor bearing mice within 30-60\xa0min after 4-5 administrations of PD-L1 or PD-1 mAb but not CTLA-4 antibody treatment. These events occurred only in mice bearing the highly inflammatory 4T1 tumor and did not occur in mice bearing non-inflammatory tumors. We observed that mortality was associated with systemic accumulation of IgG1 antibodies, antibodies specific to the PD-1 mAb, and accumulation of Gr-1high neutrophils in lungs which have been implicated in the IgG mediated pathway of anaphylaxis. Anti-PD-1 associated toxicities were alleviated when PD-1 blockade was combined with the therapeutic HSP90 inhibitor, ganetespib, which impaired immune responses toward the xenogeneic PD-1 mAb. This study highlights a previously uncharacterized fatal hypersensitivity exacerbated by the PD-1/PD-L1 axis in the broadly used 4T1 tumor model as well as an interesting relationship between this particular class of checkpoint blockade and tumor-dependent immunomodulation.']	('Mall', 'Christine')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27057445	2016	08	Vaccine-induced but not tumor-derived Interleukin-10 dictates the efficacy of Interleukin-10 blockade in therapeutic vaccination.	['Blocking antibodies against immunosuppressive molecules have shown promising results in cancer patients. However, there are not enough data to define those conditions dictating treatment efficacy. In this scenario, IL-10 is a cytokine with controversial effects on tumor growth. Thus, our aim was to characterize in which setting IL-10 blockade may potentiate the beneficial effects of a therapeutic vaccine In the IL-10-expressing B16-OVA and TC-1 P3 (A15) tumor models, therapeutic vaccination with tumor antigens plus the TLR7 ligand Imiquimod increased IL-10 production. Although blockade of IL-10 signal with anti-IL-10R antibodies did not inhibit tumor growth, when combined with vaccination it enhanced tumor rejection, associated with stronger innate and adaptive immune responses. Interestingly, a similar enhancement on immune responses was observed after simultaneous vaccination and IL-10 blockade in naive mice. However, when using vaccines containing as adjuvants the TLR3 ligand poly(I:C) or anti-CD40 agonistic antibodies, despite tumor IL-10 expression, anti-IL-10R antibodies did not provide any beneficial effect on tumor growth and antitumor immune responses. Of note, as opposed to Imiquimod, vaccination with this type of adjuvants did not induce IL-10 and correlated with a lack of in vitro IL-10 production by dendritic cells (DC). Finally, in B16-OVA-bearing mice, blockade of IL-10 during therapeutic vaccination with a multiple adjuvant combination (MAC) with potent immunostimulatory properties but still inducing IL-10 led to superior antitumor immunity and complete tumor rejection. These results suggest that for therapeutic antitumor vaccination, blockade of vaccine-induced IL-10 is more relevant than tumor-associated IL-10.']	('Llopiz', 'Diana')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27057444	2016	08	PD-L1 mediated the differentiation of tumor-infiltrating CD19+ B lymphocytes and T cells in Invasive breast cancer.	['Accumulating evidence suggests that B cells play important roles in inhibiting the immune response in autoimmune disorders and human tumors as well as murine tumor models. In an effort to explore the role of B cells in human breast cancer etiology, we examined the presence of CD19+ B lymphocytes in 134 cases of invasive breast carcinoma (IBCa) and 31 breast fibroadenoma, and assessed its relationship with PD-L1 (programmed death-ligand 1) expression in breast cancer. We found that the density of CD19+ B lymphocytes was higher in IBCa compared with fibroadenoma, and significantly associated with increasing tumor grade, negative estrogen status. Similar findings were observed for the expression of IL-10 in IBCa. Meanwhile, CD19+ B lymphocytes were shown to be highly coincident with PD-L1 and IL-10 in IBCa. We further demonstrated that CD19+ B cells can differentiate into CD19+CD24+CD38+ B cells when co-cultured with PD-L1hi MDA-MB231 cells. In addition, the percentage of CD19+CD24+CD38+ B cells was higher in breast tissue and peripheral blood cells of IBCa patients than that of benign tumor and health individuals. And CD19+CD24+CD38+ B cells were found to be IL-10 secreting B cells. Finally, we showed that CD19+ B cells from IBCa patients but not healthy individuals induced formation of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells when co-cultured with T cells from IBCa patients and healthy subjects (80.4% and 30.8% respectively). The induction of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ T cells by CD19+ B cells was further shown to be mediated by PD-L1. Together, these results are suggestive of a role for CD19+ B lymphocytes in immune suppression and tumor evasion via PD-L1 in breast cancer.']	('Guan', 'Honggeng')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']
27057443	2016	08	Drug-induced hyperploidy stimulates an antitumor NK cell response mediated by NKG2D and DNAM-1 receptors.	['Formation of polyploid or aneuploid cells is a pathological hallmark of malignant tumors. Cell cycle checkpoint mechanisms play a crucial role in ensuring genomic integrity during mitosis, avoiding the generation of aneuploid cells. Additionally, cancer cell DNA ploidy is subjected to extrinsic controls operated by activation of adaptive immune responses mediated by T cells. NK cells exert a central role in the innate anticancer immunity; however, the mechanisms involved in the recognition of tumor cells by NK cells have not been fully elucidated. Herein, we report that drug-induced polyploidy in cancer cells activates antitumor responses mediated by NK cells. Thus, hyperploidy-inducing chemotherapeutic agents strongly upregulate the tumor expression of ligands for the NK cell activating receptors NKG2D and DNAM-1. Drug-induced hyperploidy modulated the repertoire of activating receptors and the cytokine profile of NK cells, rendering tumor cells more susceptible to NK cell-mediated lysis through the activation of NKG2D and DNAM-1 receptors. In addition, hyperploidization stimulated the production of IL-2 by CD4 T cells, which induced NK cell proliferation and activity. The stimulation of MICA, a key NKG2D ligand, in hyperploid cells was mainly mediated by ATM protein kinase. Likewise, pharmacological inhibition of key regulators of endoplasmic reticulum stress in certain cell models supports a role for this pathway in NKG2D ligand upregulation. Overall, our findings indicate that, besides the cytotoxic effect on tumor cells, the therapeutic activity of anti-mitotic drugs may be mediated by the induction of a coordinated antitumor immune response involving NK and T cells.']	('Acebes-Huerta', 'Andrea')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Two major challenges facing cancer immunotherapy are the relatively low therapeutic efficacy and the potential side effects. New drug delivery system and efficient drug combination are required to overcome these challenges. We utilize an alginate hydrogel system to locally deliver 2 FDA-approved drugs, celecoxib and programmed death 1 (PD-1) monoclonal antibody (mAb), to treat tumor-bearing mice. In two cancer models, B16-F10 melanoma and 4T1 metastatic breast cancer, the alginate hydrogel delivery system significantly improves the antitumor activities of celecoxib (CXB), PD-1 mAb, or both combined. These effects are associated with the sustained high concentrations of the drugs in peripheral circulation and within tumor regions. Strikingly, the simultaneous dual local delivery of celecoxib and PD-1 from this hydrogel system synergistically enhanced the presence of CD4+inteferon (IFN)-?+ and CD8+IFN-?+ T cells within the tumor as well as in the immune system. These effects are accompanied with reduced CD4+FoxP3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and myeloid derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) in the tumor, reflecting a weakened immuosuppressive response. Furthermore, this combinatorial therapy increases the expression of two anti-angiogenic chemokines C-X-C motif ligand (CXCL) 9 and CXCL10, and suppresses the intratumoral production of interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, and cycloxygenase-2 (COX2), suggesting a dampened pro-tumor angiogenic and inflammatory microenvironment.

['In experimental mouse models of cancer, increasingly compelling evidence point toward a contribution of tumor associated macrophages (TAM) to tumor lymphangiogenesis. Corresponding experimental observations in human cancer remain scarce although lymphatic metastasis is widely recognized as a predominant route for tumor spread. We previously showed that, in malignant tumors of untreated breast cancer (BC) patients, TIE-2-expressing monocytes (TEM) are highly proangiogenic immunosuppressive cells and that TIE-2 and VEGFR signaling pathways drive TEM immunosuppressive function. We report here that, in human BC, TEM express the canonical lymphatic markers LYVE-1, Podoplanin, VEGFR-3 and PROX-1. Critically, both TEM acquisition of lymphatic markers and insertion into lymphatic vessels were observed in tumors but not in adjacent non-neoplastic tissues, suggesting that the tumor microenvironment shapes both TEM phenotype and spatial distribution. We assessed the lymphangiogenic activity of TEM isolated from dissociated primary breast tumors in vitro and in vivo using endothelial cells (EC) sprouting assay and corneal vascularization assay, respectively. We show that, in addition to their known hemangiogenic function, TEM isolated from breast tumor display a lymphangiogenic activity. Importantly, TIE-2 and VEGFR pathways display variable contributions to TEM angiogenic and lymphangiogenic activities across BC patients; however, combination of TIE-2 and VEGFR kinase inhibitors abrogated these activities and overcame inter-patient variability. These results highlight the direct contribution of tumor TEM to the breast tumor lymphatic network and suggest a combined use of TIE-2 and VEGFR kinase inhibitors as a therapeutic approach to block hem- and lymphangiogenesis in BC.']	('Bron', 'Sylvian')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

The frequency at baseline and along the treatment of circulating T central memory cells expressing activation/differentiation markers, such as CD3+CD4+CD45RO+BTLA+, CD3+CD4+4-1BB or Th17 lymphocytes correlated with the clinical outcome of MM patients. Moreover, either the absence or the presence of soluble NKG2D ligands (ULBP-1 or -2) at baseline in the serum of MM patients enabled to discriminate subjects with long-term survival (median overall survival, (OS) = 33.6 mo for ULBP-1 and -2) from poor survivors (OS = 9.8 or 6.6 mo, respectively).

Henceforth, our primary aim was to identify the immunogenic cell death (ICD)-derived metagene signatures in breast, lung and ovarian cancer that associate with improved patient survival. To this end, we analyzed the prognostic impact of differential gene-expression of 33 pre-clinically-validated ICD-parameters through a large-scale meta-analysis involving 3,983 patients ('discovery' dataset) across lung (1,432), breast (1,115) and ovarian (1,436) malignancies. The main results were also substantiated in 'validation' datasets consisting of 818 patients of same cancer-types (i.e. 285 breast/274 lung/259 ovarian). The ICD-associated parameters exhibited a highly-clustered and largely cancer type-specific prognostic impact. Interestingly, we delineated ICD-derived consensus-metagene signatures that exhibited a positive prognostic impact that was either cancer type-independent or specific. Importantly, most of these ICD-derived consensus-metagenes (acted as attractor-metagenes and thereby) 'attracted' highly co-expressing sets of genes or convergent-metagenes. These convergent-metagenes also exhibited positive prognostic impact in respective cancer types. Remarkably, we found that the cancer type-independent consensus-metagene acted as an 'attractor' for cancer-specific convergent-metagenes. This reaffirms that the immunological prognostic landscape of cancer tends to segregate between cancer-independent and cancer-type specific gene signatures. Moreover, this prognostic landscape was largely dominated by the classical T cell activity/infiltration/function-related biomarkers. Interestingly, each cancer type tended to associate with biomarkers representing a specific T cell activity or function rather than pan-T cell biomarkers. Thus, our analysis confirms that ICD can serve as a platform for discovery of novel prognostic metagenes.""]"	('Garg', 'Abhishek D')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Defects in natural killer (NK) cell functions are necessary for tumor immune escape, but their underlying regulatory mechanisms in human cancers remain largely unknown. Here we showed, in detailed studies of NK cells from 235 untreated patients with gastric cancer (GC), the NK cell density in GC tissues could predict improved survival of patients. However, NK cells were significantly decreased in number with advanced-stage GC. A multivariate Cox analysis revealed that the intratumoral NK cell density was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival and disease-free survival in the GC patients. Most of the intratumoral NK cells exhibited a normal phenotype and secreted normal levels of cytokines, but the expression of Ki67 was decreased compared with NK cells from nontumoral regions. Moreover, the levels of intratumoral NK cells were negatively correlated with the intratumoral expression of cyclooxygenase-2. Furthermore, we found that PGE2 derived from GC cells suppressed NK cell proliferation and increased apoptosis in vitro. These data reveal that tumor-derived PGE2 is critical for inducing NK cell dysfunction in GC and demonstrate that an extensive infiltration of NK cells predicts a good prognosis in patients with GC. Our findings suggest that immunosuppressive barriers erected by tumors greatly hamper the antitumor activity of human NK cells, thereby favoring tumor outgrowth and progression.']	('Li', 'Tuanjie')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['T-cell bispecific antibodies (TCBs) are a novel therapeutic tool designed to selectively recruit T-cells to tumor cells and simultaneously activate them. However, it is currently unknown whether the dysfunctional state of T-cells, embedded into the tumor microenvironment, imprints on the therapeutic activity of TCBs. We performed a comprehensive analysis of activation and effector functions of tumor-infiltrating T-cells (TILs) in different tumor types, upon stimulation by a TCB targeting folate receptor 1 and CD3 (FolR1-TCB). We observed a considerable heterogeneity in T-cell activation, cytokine production and tumor cell killing upon exposure to FolR1-TCB among different FolR1-expressing tumors. Of note, tumors presenting with a high frequency of PD-1hi TILs displayed significantly impaired tumor cell killing and T-cell function. Further characterization of additional T-cell inhibitory receptors revealed that PD-1hi TILs defined a T-cell subset with particularly high levels of multiple inhibitory receptors compared with PD-1int and PD-1neg T-cells. PD-1 blockade could restore cytokine secretion but not cytotoxicity of TILs in a subset of patients with scarce PD-1hi expressing cells; in contrast, patients with abundance of PD-1hi expressing T-cells did not benefit from PD-1 blockade. Our data highlight that FolR1-TCB is a promising novel immunotherapeutic treatment option which is capable of activating intratumoral T-cells in different carcinomas. However, its therapeutic efficacy may be substantially hampered by a pre-existing dysfunctional state of T-cells, reflected by abundance of intratumoral PD-1hi T-cells. These findings present a rationale for combinatorial approaches of TCBs with other therapeutic strategies targeting T-cell dysfunction.']	('Schreiner', 'Jens')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Tumor-infiltrating T and B lymphocytes could have the potential to affect cancer prognosis. The objective of this study was to investigate the prognostic significance of tumor infiltration by CD8 and CD4 T cells, and B lymphocytes in patients with localized gastric cancer. In a retrospective cohort of 82 patients with localized gastric cancer and treated by surgery we quantitatively assessed by immunohistochemistry on surgical specimen, immune infiltrates of IL-17+, CD8+, Foxp3+, Tbet+ T cells and CD20+ B cells both in the tumor core and at the invasive margin via immunohistochemical analyses of surgical specimens. We observed that CD8+ and IL17+ T-cell densities were not significantly associated with gastric cancer prognosis. In contrast, high infiltration of Tbet+ T cells, high numbers of CD20+ B-cell follicles, and low infiltration of Foxp3+ T cells, were associated with better relapse-free survival. Interestingly, treatment with neoadjuvant chemotherapy or histological tumor type (diffuse versus intestinal) did not influence type and density of immune infiltrates or their prognostic value. Immunohistochemical analysis of the gastric cancer stromal microenvironment revealed organized T and B cell aggregates, with strong structural analogies to normal secondary lymphoid organs and which could be considered as tertiary lymphoid structures. Using transcriptomic data from an independent cohort of 365 localized gastric cancer, we confirmed that a coordinated Th1, and B cell stromal gene signature is associated with better outcome. Altogether, these data suggest that tumor infiltration by B and Th1 T cells could affect gastric cancer prognosis and may be used to better define the outcome of patients with localized gastric cancer.']	('Hennequin', 'Audrey')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['Some evidence indicated that chemoresistance associates with the acquisition of cancer stem-like properties. Recent studies suggested that chemokines can promote the chemoresistance and stem cell properties in various cancer cells, while the underling mechanism is still not completely illustrated. In our study, we found that CCL21 can upregulate the expression of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and stem cell property markers such as Bmi-1, Nanog, and OCT-4 in colorectal cancer (CRC) HCT116 cells and then improve the cell survival rate and mammosphere formation. Our results suggested that Snail was crucial for CCL21-mediated chemoresistance and cancer stem cell property in CRC cells. Further, we observed that CCL21 treatment increased the protein but not mRNA levels of Snail, which suggested that CCL21 upregulates Snail via posttranscriptional ways. The downstream signals AKT/GSK-3? mediated CCL21 induced the upregulation of Snail due to the fact that CCL21 treatment can obviously phosphorylate both AKT and GSK-3?. The inhibitor of PI3K/Akt, LY294002 significantly abolished CCL21 induced chemoresistance and mammosphere formation of HCT116 cells. Collectively, our results in the present study revealed that CCL21 can facilitate chemoresistance and stem cell property of CRC cells via the upregulation of P-gp, Bmi-1, Nanog, and OCT-4 through AKT/GSK-3?/Snail signals, which suggested a potential therapeutic approach to CRC patients.']	('Lu', 'Lin-Lin')	Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity	Oxid Med Cell Longev	['eng']

['Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from somatic cells of patients hold great promise for autologous cell therapies. One of the possible applications of iPSCs is to use them as a cell source for producing autologous lymphocytes for cell-based therapy against cancer. Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) that express programmed cell death protein-1 (PD-1) are tumor-reactive T cells, and adoptive cell therapy with autologous TILs has been found to achieve durable complete response in selected patients with metastatic melanoma. Here, we describe the derivation of human iPSCs from melanoma TILs expressing high level of PD-1 by Sendai virus-mediated transduction of the four transcription factors, OCT3/4, SOX2, KLF4, and c-MYC. TIL-derived iPSCs display embryonic stem cell-like morphology, have normal karyotype, express stem cell-specific surface antigens and pluripotency-associated transcription factors, and have the capacity to differentiate in vitro and in vivo. A wide variety of T cell receptor gene rearrangement patterns in TIL-derived iPSCs confirmed the heterogeneity of T cells infiltrating melanomas.

['Colorectal cancer (CRC) represents one of the most prevalent and lethal malignant neoplasms and every individual of age 50 and above should undergo regular CRC screening. Currently, the most effective preventive screening procedure to detect adenomatous polyps, the precursors to CRC, is colonoscopy. Since every colorectal cancer starts as a polyp, detecting all polyps and removing them is crucial. By exactly doing that, colonoscopy reduces CRC incidence by 80%, however it is an invasive procedure that might have unpleasant and, in rare occasions, dangerous side effects. Despite numerous efforts over the past two decades, a non-invasive screening method for the general population with detection rates for adenomas and CRC similar to that of colonoscopy has not yet been established. Recent advances in next generation sequencing technologies have yet to be successfully applied to this problem, because the detection of rare mutations has been hindered by the systematic biases due to sequencing context and the base calling quality of NGS. We present the first study that applies the high read accuracy and depth of single molecule, real time, circular consensus sequencing (SMRT-CCS) to the detection of mutations in stool DNA in order to provide a non-invasive, sensitive and accurate test for CRC. In stool DNA isolated from patients diagnosed with adenocarcinoma, we are able to detect mutations at frequencies below 0.5% with no false positives. This approach establishes a foundation for a non-invasive, highly sensitive assay to screen the population for CRC and the early stage adenomas that lead to CRC.']	('Russo', 'Giancarlo')	Applied & translational genomics	Appl Transl Genom	['eng']

27051587	2016	11	The mTOR pathway in obesity driven gastrointestinal cancers: Potential targets and clinical trials.	['The mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) is a crucial point of convergence between growth factor signalling, metabolism, nutrient status and cellular proliferation. The mTOR pathway is heavily implicated in the progression of many cancers and is emerging as an important driver of gastrointestinal (GI) malignancies. Due to its central role in adapting metabolism to environmental conditions, mTOR signalling is also believed to be critical in the development of obesity. Recent research has delineated that excessive nutrient intake can promote signalling through the mTOR pathway and possibly evoke changes to cellular metabolism that could accelerate obesity related cancers. Acting through its two effector complexes mTORC1 and mTORC2, mTOR dictates the transcription of genes important in glycolysis, lipogenesis, protein translation and synthesis and has recently been defined as a central mediator of the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Activation of the mTOR pathway is involved in both the pathogenesis of GI malignancies and development of resistance to conventional chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The use of mTOR inhibitors is a promising therapeutic option in many GI malignancies, with greatest clinical efficacy seen in combination regimens. Recent research has also provided insight into crosstalk between mTOR and other pathways which could potentially expand the list of therapeutic targets in the mTOR pathway. Here we review the available strategies for targeting the mTOR pathway in GI cancers. We discuss current clinical trials of both established and novel mTOR inhibitors, with particular focus on combinations of these drugs with conventional chemotherapy, radiotherapy and targeted therapies.']	('Malley', 'Cian O')	BBA clinical	BBA Clin	['eng']
27051585	2016	11	Inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer and type 2 diabetes mellitus: The links.	['The co-occurrence of the three disease entities, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), colorectal cancer (CRC), type 2diabetes mellitus (T2DM) along with inflammation and dismicrobism has been frequently reported. Some authors have even suggested that dysbiosis could be the link through a molecular crosstalk of multiple inflammatory loops including TGF?, NFKB, TNF? and ROS among others. This review focuses on the inflammatory process along with the role of microbiota in the pathophysiology of the three diseases. The etiology of IBD is multifactorial, and like CRC and T2DM, it is associated with a widespread and sustained GI inflammation and dismicrobism, whereby an array of pro-inflammatory mediators and other related biomolecules are up-regulated, both locally and systematically. Such a persistent or an inadequately resolved chronic inflammation may be a causative agent, in the presence other factors, leading to several pathologies such as IBD, CRC and T2DM. TGF? plays a crucial role in pancreatic ? cell malfunctioning as glucotoxicity stimulates its signaling cascade through smad 3, IL-6 and epithelial to mesenchymal transition. Such a cascade could lead to macrophages and other cells recruitment, inflammation, then IBD and CRC. NFkB is also another key regulator in the crosstalk among the pathways leading to the three disease entities. It plays a major role in linking inflammation to cancer development through its ability to up regulate several inflammatory and tumor promoting cytokines like: IL-6, IL-1 ? and TNF ?, as well as genes like BCL2 and BCLXL. It activates JAK/STAT signaling network via STAT3 transcription factors and promotes epithelial to mesenchymal transition. It also increases the risk for T2DM in obese people. In brief, NFKB is a matchmaker between inflammation, IBD, cancer and diabetes. In addition, TNF? plays a pivotal role in systemic inflammation. It is increased in the mucosa of IBD patients and has a central role in its pathogenesis. It also activates other signaling pathways like NFKB and MAPK leading to CRC. It is also overexpressed in the adipose tissues of obese patients thus linking it to T2DM, chronic inflammation and consequently CRC. On the other hand, increasing evidence suggests that dysbiosis plays a role in initiating, maintaining and determining the severity of IBD. Actually, among its functions, it modulates genotoxic metabolites which are able to induce CRC, a fact proven to be sustained by stool transfer from patients with CRC. Probiotics, however, may actively prevent CRC as well as IBD and results in a significant decrease in fasting glycemia in T2DM patients. In conclusion, IBD, CRC and T2DM are commonly occurring interrelated clinical problems. They share a common basis influenced by an inflammatory process, an imbalance in intestinal microbiota, and a crosstalk between various signaling pathways. Would probiotics interrupt the crosstalk or orient it in the physiological direction?']	('Jurjus', 'Abdo')	BBA clinical	BBA Clin	['eng']

Because of this, weekly regimens are a cornerstone in metastatic disease. Taxanes like paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel as well as antracyclines are often used in palliative treatment. Further advances to increase dose density have led to the concept of daily metronomic schedules with oral chemotherapeutic drugs like cyclophosphamide, capecitabine, or vinorelbine. Metronomic chemotherapy affects tumor angiogenesis and also weakens immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, promoting better control of tumor progression.

Oxidative stress is a conceivable link between diet and diseases, thus food antioxidants, counteracting the damage caused by oxidation, are potential tools for fight age-related diseases and cancer. Resveratrol (RSV), a polyphenolic antioxidant from grapes, has gained enormous attention particularly because of its ability to induce growth arrest and apoptosis in cancer cells, and it has been proposed as both chemopreventive and therapeutic agent for cancer and other diseases. Even though the effects of RSV have been studied in prostate cancer cells and animal models, little is known about its effects on normal cells and tissues. To address this issue, we have investigated the effects of RSV on EPN cells, a human non-transformed prostate cell line, focusing on the relationship between RSV and p66Shc, a redox enzyme whose activities strikingly intersect those of RSV. p66Shc activity is regulated by phosphorylation of serine 36 (Ser36) and has been related to mitochondrial oxidative stress, apoptosis induction, regulation of cell proliferation and migration. Here we show that RSV inhibits adhesion, proliferation and migration of EPN cells, and that these effects are associated to induction of dose- and time-dependent p66Shc-Ser36 phosphorylation and ERK1/2 de-phosphorylation. Moreover, we found that RSV is able to activate also p52Shc, another member of the Shc protein family.

To accomplish this aim, we use a novel model formulation for the log-hazard based on a low-rank thin plate linear spline that readily facilitates adjustment for covariates with time-dependent and proportional hazards effects, possibly subject to shape restrictions. We investigate the performance of our model choices via simulation. We then analyze colorectal cancer data from a clinical trial comparing the effectiveness of two novel treatment regimes relative to the standard of care for overall survival. We estimate a time-dependent hazard ratio for each novel regime relative to the standard of care while adjusting for the effect of aspartate transaminase, a biomarker of liver function, that is subject to a non-decreasing shape restriction.']	('Murray', 'Thomas A')	Bayesian analysis	Bayesian Anal	['eng']

['Conventional transbronchial needle aspiration (TBNA) using 19-gauge needles can obtain larger histological specimens for hilar-mediastinal diagnosis. A new 19-gauge eXcelon needle was introduced in Taiwan in July 2012. We prospectively enrolled patients with hilar-mediastinal lesions and pathology results of suspected benign origin or lymphoproliferative processes, to perform TBNA using a 19-gauge eXcelon needle, between July 2012 and December 2012. The results were compared with historical control of TBNA using a WANG MW-319 needle between January 2011 and June 2012. The procedure was performed by the same pulmonologist, and rapid on-site cytologic evaluation was used. The 19-gauge eXcelon needle was used in nine patients with 15 lymph nodes aspirated, with a mean diameter of 23.3 ± 10.7\u2009mm. The mean number of needle passes was 2.7 ± 1.4, with a diagnostic accuracy of 77.8%. The MW-319 needle was used in 12 patients with 18 lymph nodes aspirated, with a mean diameter of 21.3 ± 5.7\u2009mm. The mean number of needle passes was 2.2 ± 0.4, with a diagnostic accuracy of 75.0%. Neither technical nor major clinical complications were noted in either group. We concluded that the 19-gauge eXcelon needle was as safe and effective as the MW-319 needle. A more adequate specimen could be obtained and fewer needle passes were required with the MW-319 needle, although the difference did not reach significance.']	('Hsu', 'Li-Han')	Thoracic cancer	Thorac Cancer	['eng']

27040924	2016	12	Recurrent TERT promoter mutations in urothelial carcinoma and potential clinical applications.	['Increased telomerase activity is associated with almost all types of advanced human cancers with unknown molecular mechanism(s). Two recurrent point mutations in the promoter region of telomerase reverse transcriptase (TERT)--the key subunit of telomerase--have recently been identified in melanoma as well as a small sample of bladder cancer cell lines. However, the incidence and clinical-pathological significance of these mutations in urothelial carcinoma have not been well established yet. We collected 86 specimens of urothelial carcinoma including upper and lower urinary tract: high grade and low grade, invasive and noninvasive, and primary and metastatic. We also included some matched benign urothelium and common benign bladder lesions: cystitis, nephrogenic adenoma, and inverted papilloma. In addition, we collected urine samples for urothelial carcinoma workup; blood samples from patients underwent cystectomy with extensive lymphovascular invasion. All specimens were subject to polymerase chain reaction amplification and bidirectional Sanger sequencing for the TERT promoter mutations: C228T and C250T. We found that 64 (74%) of 86 carcinoma samples harbored 1 of the 2 TERT promoter mutations (C228T, n = 54; C250T, n = 10); the incidences were roughly equal regardless of site of origin, histologic grade, and invasive status. All matched benign and benign lesion samples showed wild-type sequence. These TERT promoter mutations are the most common genetic alterations in urothelial carcinoma and are not associated with tumor locations, grade, or invasiveness. Importantly, the feasibility of detecting these mutations in urine samples may provide a novel method to detect urothelial carcinoma in urine.']	('Kurtis', 'Boaz')	Annals of diagnostic pathology	Ann Diagn Pathol	['eng']

A reappraisal of fat-rich tumors of the breast based on 22 cases integrated by immunohistochemical study, molecular pathology insights, and clinical follow-up.	['We have studied 22 cases of mammary lipophyllodes tumors (LPT), analyzing their clinicopathologic features along with available follow-up. All cases were tested for cytokeratins, S100 protein, and MDM2, and in selected cases for estrogen receptor, smooth muscle actin, bcl2, desmin, and myogenin. Patients were women aged 21 to 69 years (average, 45 years), and LPT size ranged from 1.6 to 30 cm (average, 9.7 cm). Microscopically, LPT segregated as follows: atypical lipoma-like tumor/well-differentiated liposarcoma (ALT/WDL), 8 cases; myxoid, 6; and pleomorphic/poorly differentiated/round cell, 8, including a case of dedifferentiated liposarcoma. Immunohistochemistry studies showed focal positive staining for S100 and CD34 in most ALT/WDL, and desmin and myogenin in 2 cases with evidence of rhabdomyoblastic differentiation. MDM2 positivity was focally seen in 1 case. Follow-up was available in 8 cases. Multiple recurrent tumors were seen in 2 patients, and metastatic disease to the lung was seen in 2 patients. In 4 patients with a follow-up between 2 and 15 years there was no evidence of recurrent or metastatic disease. Patients with ALT/WDL (2/2) were alive with no evidence of disease; 2 of 4 patients with myxoid liposarcoma component experienced tumor recurrence, whereas pleomorphic liposarcoma LPT pursued a less favorable course although only 1 patient died of the condition. Absence of MDM2 reactivity in most cases seems not as meaningful as in fatty tumors of somatic soft parts.']	('Bacchi', 'Carlos E')	Annals of diagnostic pathology	Ann Diagn Pathol	['eng']

"[""The present issue of 'Seminars in Immunology' addresses the topic of macrophage biology, 100 years after the death of Elie Metchnikoff (May 1845-July 1916). As foreseen by Metchnikoff, the roles of macrophages in the maintenance of homeostasis and immunity against pathogens have become a broad and active area of investigation. We now start to realize that the myeloid system includes a multiplicity of cell types with diverse developmental origins and functions. Therefore, the textbook picture of a plastic and multifunctional macrophage does not meet the requirements of our current knowledge anymore. Further development toward a quantitative and molecular understanding of myeloid cell biology in vivo and their roles in tissue homeostasis and remodeling will benefit from taking this complexity into account. A tentative model to help in this pursuit and account for myeloid cell and macrophage diversity is discussed below.""]"	('Geissmann', 'F')	Seminars in immunology	Semin. Immunol.	['eng']

27034727	2016	12	An update on the role of testosterone replacement therapy in the management of hypogonadism.	['While US testosterone prescriptions have tripled in the last decade with lower trends in Europe, debate continues over the risks, benefits and appropriate use of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT). Some authors blame advertising and the availability of more convenient formulations whilst other have pointed out that the routine testing of men with erectile dysfunction (a significant marker of cardiovascular risk) and those with diabetes would inevitably increase the diagnosis of hypogonadism and lead to an increase in totally appropriate prescribing. They commented that this was merely an appropriate correction of previous underdiagnosis and undertreatment by adherence to evidence-based guidelines. Urologists and primary care physicians are the most frequent initiators of TRT, usually for erectile dysfunction. Benefits are clearly established for sexual function, increase in lean muscle mass and strength, mood and cognitive function, with possible reduction in frailty and osteoporosis. There remains no evidence that TRT is associated with increased risk of prostate cancer or symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia, yet the decision to initiate and continue therapy is often decided by urologists. The cardiovascular issues associated with TRT have been clarified by recent studies showing clearly that therapy associated with clear rise in testosterone levels are associated with reduced mortality. Studies reporting to show increased risk have been subject to flawed designs with inadequate baseline diagnosis and follow-up testing. Effectively they have compared nontreated patients with undertreated or on-compliant subjects involving a range of different therapy regimens. Recent evidence suggests long acting injections may be associated with decreased cardiovascular risk but the transdermal route may be associated with potentially relatively greater risk because of conversion to dihydrotestosterone by the effect of 5? reductase in skin. The multiple effects of TRT may add up to a considerable benefit to the patient that might be underestimated by the physician primarily concerned with his own specialty. This paper will attempt to identify who should be treated, and how they should be treated safely to achieve best outcomes, based on a comprehensive MEDLINE and EMBASE and Cochrane searches on hypogonadism, TRT and cardiovascular safety from May 2005 to May 2015. This revealed 1714 papers with 52 clinical trials and 32 placebo-controlled randomized, controlled trials.']	('Hackett', 'Geoffrey')	Therapeutic advances in urology	Ther Adv Urol	['eng']
27034725	2016	11	The role of neoadjuvant therapy in the management of locally advanced renal cell carcinoma.	['In the past decade, the armamentarium of targeted therapy agents for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has significantly increased. Improvements in response rates and survival, with more manageable side effects compared with interleukin 2/interferon immunotherapy, have been reported with the use of targeted therapy agents, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (sunitinib, sorafenib, pazopanib, axitinib), mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors (everolimus and temsirolimus) and VEGF receptor antibodies (bevacizumab). Current guidelines reflect these new therapeutic approaches with treatments based on risk category, histology and line of therapy in the metastatic setting. However, while radical nephrectomy remains the standard of care for locally advanced RCC, the migration and use of these agents from salvage to the neoadjuvant setting for large unresectable masses, high-level venous tumor thrombus involvement, and patients with imperative indications for nephron sparing has been increasingly described in the literature. Several trials have recently been published and some are still recruiting patients in the neoadjuvant setting. While the results of these trials will inform and guide the use of these agents in the neoadjuvant setting, there still remains a considerable lack of consensus in the literature regarding the effectiveness, safety and clinical utility of neoadjuvant therapy. The goal of this review is to shed light on the current body of evidence with regards to the use of neoadjuvant treatments in the setting of locally advanced RCC.']	('Borregales', 'Leonardo D')	Therapeutic advances in urology	Ther Adv Urol	['eng']

Arguably the most important and controversial of these is the increased risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Although multiple observational studies have shown that men treated with ADT are at increased risk of developing atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, our understanding of the biological mechanisms that might underlie this phenomenon is still evolving. In this review, we discuss some of the mechanisms that have been proposed to date, including ADT-induced metabolic changes that promote the development and progression of atherosclerotic plaques as well as direct local effects of hormonal factors on plaque growth, rupture and thrombosis.']	('Zareba', 'Piotr')	Therapeutic advances in urology	Ther Adv Urol	['eng']

27034684	2016	12	Spontaneous Physical Activity Downregulates Pax7 in Cancer Cachexia.	['Emerging evidence suggests that the muscle microenvironment plays a prominent role in cancer cachexia. We recently showed that NF-kB-induced Pax7 overexpression impairs the myogenic potential of muscle precursors in cachectic mice, suggesting that lowering Pax7 expression may be beneficial in cancer cachexia. We evaluated the muscle regenerative potential after acute injury in C26 colon carcinoma tumor-bearing mice and healthy controls. Our analyses confirmed that the delayed muscle regeneration observed in muscles form tumor-bearing mice was associated with a persistent local inflammation and Pax7 overexpression. Physical activity is known to exert positive effects on cachectic muscles. However, the mechanism by which a moderate voluntary exercise ameliorates muscle wasting is not fully elucidated. To verify if physical activity affects Pax7 expression, we hosted control and C26-bearing mice in wheel-equipped cages and we found that voluntary wheel running downregulated Pax7 expression in muscles from tumor-bearing mice. As expected, downregulation of Pax7 expression was associated with a rescue of muscle mass and fiber size. Our findings shed light on the molecular basis of the beneficial effect exerted by a moderate physical exercise on muscle stem cells in cancer cachexia. Furthermore, we propose voluntary exercise as a physiological tool to counteract the overexpression of Pax7 observed in cancer cachexia.']	('Coletti', 'Dario')	Stem cells international	Stem Cells Int	['eng']
27034534	2016	06	A Proportional Hazards Regression Model for the Sub-distribution with Covariates Adjusted Censoring Weight for Competing Risks Data.	['With competing risks data, one often needs to assess the treatment and covariate effects on the cumulative incidence function. Fine and Gray proposed a proportional hazards regression model for the subdistribution of a competing risk with the assumption that the censoring distribution and the covariates are independent. Covariate-dependent censoring sometimes occurs in medical studies. In this paper, we study the proportional hazards regression model for the subdistribution of a competing risk with proper adjustments for covariate-dependent censoring. We consider a covariate-adjusted weight function by fitting the Cox model for the censoring distribution and using the predictive probability for each individual. Our simulation study shows that the covariate-adjusted weight estimator is basically unbiased when the censoring time depends on the covariates, and the covariate-adjusted weight approach works well for the variance estimator as well. We illustrate our methods with bone marrow transplant data from the Center for International Blood and Marrow Transplant Research (CIBMTR). Here cancer relapse and death in complete remission are two competing risks.']	('He', 'Peng')	Scandinavian journal of statistics, theory and applications	Scand Stat Theory Appl	['eng']

"[""Delivering radiation to eradicate a solid tumor while minimizing damage to nearby critical organs remains a challenge. For esophageal cancer, radiation therapy may damage the heart or lungs, and several qualitatively different, possibly recurrent toxicities associated with chemoradiation or surgery may occur, each at two or more possible grades. In this article, we describe a Bayesian group sequential clinical trial design, based on total toxicity burden (TTB) and progression-free survival duration, for comparing two radiation therapy modalities for esophageal cancer. Each patient's toxicities are modeled as a multivariate doubly stochastic Poisson point process, with marks identifying toxicity grades. Each grade of each type of toxicity is assigned a severity weight, elicited from clinical oncologists familiar with the disease and treatments. TTB is defined as a severity-weighted sum over the different toxicities that may occur up to 12 months from the start of treatment. Latent frailties are used to formulate a multivariate model for all outcomes. Group sequential decision rules are based on posterior mean TTB and progression-free survival time. The proposed design is shown to provide both larger power and smaller mean sample size when compared to a conventional bivariate group sequential design.""]"	('Hobbs', 'Brian P')	Journal of the Royal Statistical Society.

['Desmoid tumors are rare clonal fibroblastic proliferations that can arise at abdominal or extra-abdominal sites. Complete surgical resection is the primary treatment for resectable desmoid tumors, but a high rate of local recurrence has been reported even after complete resection. For patients with a recurrent tumor, the goals of treatment are to control the recurrence, maintain quality of life, and prolong survival. Radiofrequency ablation, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and other medical therapies can be used as alternative methods, but there are considerable controversies over the roles of these methods in the management of desmoid tumors. High-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is a minimally invasive and effective method for treatment of solid tumors. We used HIFU to treat four patients with intra-abdominal desmoid tumors from June 2011 to September 2013. Post-procedural pain was seen in all patients. One patient had an intra-abdominal abscess and another suffered a slight injury to the femoral nerve. The patients were followed up for 19-46 months (mean 34 months) until April 2015.

27029009	2015	03	R-Ras Inhibits VEGF-Induced p38MAPK Activation and HSP27 Phosphorylation in Endothelial Cells.	['R-Ras is a Ras family small GTPase that is highly expressed in mature functional blood vessels in normal tissues. It inhibits pathological angiogenesis and promotes vessel maturation and stabilization. Previous studies suggest that R-Ras affects cellular signaling in endothelial cells, pericytes and smooth-muscle cells to regulate vessel formation and remodeling in adult tissues. R-Ras suppresses VEGF-induced endothelial permeability and vessel sprouting while promoting normalization of pathologically developing vessels in mice. It attenuates VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR2) activation by inhibiting internalization of the receptor upon VEGF ligand binding, leading to significant reduction of VEGFR2 autophosphorylation. Here, we show that R-Ras strongly suppresses the VEGF-dependent activation of stress-activated protein kinase-2/p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (SAPK2/p38MAPK) and the phosphorylation of downstream heat-shock protein 27 (HSP27), a regulator of actin cytoskeleton organization, in endothelial cells. The suppression of p38MAPK activation and HSP27 phosphorylation by R-Ras concurred with altered actin cytoskeleton architecture, reduced membrane protrusion and inhibition of endothelial cell migration toward VEGF. Silencing of endogenous R-Ras by RNA interference increased membrane protrusion and cell migration stimulated by VEGF, and these effects were offset by p38MAPK inhibitor SB203580. These results suggest that R-Ras regulates angiogenic activities of endothelial cells in part via inhibition of the p38MAPK-HSP27 axis of VEGF signaling.']	('Sawada', 'Junko')	Journal of vascular research	J.

['Bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (BMMSCs) represent a crucial component of multiple myeloma (MM) microenvironment supporting its progression and proliferation. Recently, microRNAs have become an important point of interest for research on micro-environmental interactions in MM with some evidence of tumor supportive roles in MM. In this study, we examined the role of miR-223 for MM support in BMMSCs of 56 patients with MM (MM-BMMSCs). miR-223 expression in MM-BMMSCs was reduced by the presence of MM cells in vitro in a cell-contact dependent manner compared to mono-cultured MM-BMMSCs. Co-cultivation of MM cells and MM-BMMSCs induced activation of notch amongst others via jagged-2/notch-2 leading to increased expression of Hes1, Hey2, or Hes5 in both cell types. Cultivation of MM-BMMSCs with increasing levels of recombinant jagged-2 reduced miR-223 and increased Hes1 levels in a concentration-dependent manner. Transient reduction of miR-223 levels increased VEGF and IL-6 expression and secretion by MM-BMMSCs. In addition, reduction of miR-223 degraded the osteogenic differentiation potential of MM-BMMSCs. Inhibition of notch signaling induced apoptosis in both MM cells and MM-BMMSCs. Furthermore, it increased miR-223 levels and reduced expression of VEGF and IL-6 by both cell types. These data provide first evidence that miR-223 participates in different MM supporting pathways in MM-BMMSCs inlcuding regulation of cytokine secretion and expression as well as osteogenic differentiation of MM-BMMSCs. More insights on the role of miR-223 in MM-BMMSCs and in cellular interactions between MM cells and MM-BMMSCs could provide starting points for a more efficient anti-myeloma treatment by targeting of notch signaling. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.']	('Berenstein', 'Rimma')	Molecular carcinogenesis	Mol.

['The C-terminal fragment of Clostridium perfringens enterotoxin (C-CPE) modulates the tight junction protein claudin and disrupts the tight junctional barrier. It also can enhance the effectiveness of anticancer agents. However, the detailed mechanisms of the effects of C-CPE remain unclear in both normal and cancerous cells. The C-CPE mutant called C-CPE 194 binds only to claudin-4, but the C-CPE 194 mutant called C-CPE m19 binds not only to claudin-4 but also to claudin-1. In the present study, to investigate the mechanisms of the effects of C-CPE on claudin expression, the tight junctional functions and the cytotoxicity of anticancer agents, human pancreatic cancer cells, and normal human pancreatic duct epithelial cells (HPDEs) were treated with C-CPE 194 and C-CPE m19. In well-differentiated cells of the pancreatic cancer cell line HPAC, C-CPE 194 and C-CPE m19 disrupted both the barrier and fence functions without changes in expression of claudin-1 and -4, together with an increase of MAPK phosphorylation. C-CPE 194, but not C-CPE m19, enhanced the cytotoxicity of the anticancer agents gemcitabine and S-1. In poorly differentiated pancreatic cancer cell line PANC-1, C-CPE 194, but not C-CPE m19, decreased claudin-4 expression and enhanced MAPK activity and the cytotoxicity of the anticancer agents. In normal HPDEs, C-CPE 194 and C-CPE m19 decreased claudin-4 expression and enhanced the MAPK activity, whereas they did not affect the cytotoxicity of the anticancer agents.

['Mesoblastic nephroma (MN) is the most common renal tumour in the first 3 months of life and accounts for 3-5% of all paediatric renal neoplasms. To further understand the morphological variants of MN, we identified 19 cases of MN (five classic, eight cellular and six mixed) and examined each case for markers known to be important in urogenital embryological development (PAX8, WT1 and RCC), stem cell associated markers (Oct 4, CD34 and c-kit), muscle/myofibroblastic markers (muscle specific actin, calponin and h-caldesmon), aberrant transcription factors, cell cycle regulation and other oncogenic proteins (p16, cyclin D1 and beta-catenin). Fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) testing for ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion/rearrangement revealed further differentiation between the subtypes with ETV6-NTRK3 gene fusion detected in 0/5 of the classic MN, 8/8 of the cellular MN and 5/6 of the mixed MN cohorts, respectively. Our results conclude that cyclin D1 and beta-catenin may be useful markers for differentiating between cellular MN and classic MN when the histology is not conclusive. The absence of expression of stem cell markers and markers involved in urogenital development suggests that MN is not a nephroma and most likely represents a soft tissue tumour, with congenital infantile fibrosarcoma representing cellular MN with a predilection to arise in the kidney. In addition, the immunophenotype and genetic fingerprint of mixed MN most likely represents a heterogenous group of tumours that are mostly cellular type, with areas that are phenotypically less cellular.']	('El Demellawy', 'Dina')	Pathology	Pathology	['eng']

['Distal extrahepatic bile duct (EBD) carcinoma is a rare but highly aggressive malignant neoplasm. Some in\xa0vitro studies have shown that EGFR and PI3K-Akt pathway play an important role in the carcinogenesis of bile duct carcinoma. The aim of the present study is to investigate the expression of EGFR, p-AKT, and COX-2 and the mutation of PIK3CA in distal EBD carcinoma and evaluate the association with clinicopathological factors. Ninety cases of distal extrahepatic bile duct (EBD) carcinoma specimens were studied. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) using antibodies against EGFR, p-AKT, and COX-2 was performed on TMA blocks. The PIK3CA mutation was evaluated using the PNAClamp Detection Kit from DNA samples extracted from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tissue. EGFR expression of distal EBD carcinomas was 61.9%, 26.2%, 6.0% and 6.0% in the negative, weakly positive, moderately positive, and strongly positive groups, respectively. Positive EGFR expression showed significant relationships with high T stage (p\xa0=\xa00.024). In Kaplan-Meier analysis, EGFR expression was associated with shorter cancer-specific overall survival (p\xa0=\xa00.005). Multivariate analysis also showed that moderate or strong (2+ or 3+) EGFR expression was a significant prognostic factor in distal EBD carcinoma: HR 5.286; p\xa0=\xa00.001. Ninety cases of EBD carcinoma tissue were analysed for hotspot mutations (exon 9 and 20) in the PIK3CA gene. Only one mutation was detected: a missense mutation of H1047 at exon 20. The expression levels of p-AKT and COX-2 showed no association with any clinicopathological parameters, including survival rate. Moderate and strong EGFR expressions demonstrate a direct link to poor prognosis. Although further study is warranted to understand the clinicopathological significance, our finding suggests EGFR is a useful prognostic marker of patients with distal EBD carcinoma. A low prevalence of PIK3CA mutation exists in the distal EBD carcinoma of Korean patients, indicating that mutation screening may not be useful in determining prognosis or in formulating a treatment response to targeted inhibition in Korea.']	('Moon', 'Ahrim')	Pathology	Pathology	['eng']

Large amounts of steroid hormones are locally produced in the peripheral tissues of both genders. Type 5 of 17?-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, encoded by the AKR1C3 gene, plays a pivotal role in both androgen and estrogen metabolism, and its expression was found to be deregulated in different cancers. In this study we measured AKR1C3 transcript and protein levels in nontumoral and primary tumoral gastric tissues, and evaluated their association with some clinicopathological features of gastric cancer (GC). We found decreased levels of AKR1C3 transcript (p < 0.0001) and protein (p = 0.0021) in GC tissues compared with the adjacent, apparently histopathologically normal, mucosa. Lower levels of AKR1C3 transcript were observed in diffuse and intestinal types of GC, whereas AKR1C3 protein levels were decreased in tumors with multisite localization, in diffuse histological type, T3, T4, and G3 grades. We also determined the effect of the histone deacetylase inhibitor sodium butyrate (NaBu) on AKR1C3 expression in EPG 85-257 and HGC-27 GC cell lines. We found that NaBu elevates the levels of both AKR1C3 transcript and protein in the cell lines we investigated. Together, our results suggest that decreased expression of AKR1C3 may be involved in development of GC and can be restored by NaBu.']	('Frycz', 'Bartosz Adam')	Biochemistry and cell biology = Biochimie et biologie cellulaire	Biochem.

27017967	2015	12	Phylotranscriptomic analysis uncovers a wealth of tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases variants in echinoderms.	['Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) help regulate the extracellular matrix (ECM) in animals, mostly by inhibiting matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). They are important activators of mutable collagenous tissue (MCT), which have been extensively studied in echinoderms, and the four TIMP copies in humans have been studied for their role in cancer. To understand the evolution of TIMPs, we combined 405 TIMPs from an echinoderm transcriptome dataset built from 41 specimens representing all five classes of echinoderms with variants from protostomes and chordates. We used multiple sequence alignment with various stringencies of alignment quality to cull highly divergent sequences and then conducted phylogenetic analyses using both nucleotide and amino acid sequences. Phylogenetic hypotheses consistently recovered TIMPs as diversifying in the ancestral deuterostome and these early lineages continuing to diversify in echinoderms. The four vertebrate TIMPs diversified from a single copy in the ancestral chordate, all other copies being lost. Consistent with greater MCT needs owing to body wall liquefaction, evisceration, autotomy and reproduction by fission, holothuroids had significantly more TIMPs and higher read depths per contig. Ten cysteine residues, an HPQ binding site and several other residues were conserved in at least 70% of all TIMPs. The conservation of binding sites and the placement of echinoderm TIMPs involved in MCT modification suggest that ECM regulation remains the primary function of TIMP genes, although within this role there are a large number of specialized copies.']	('Clouse', 'Ronald M')	Royal Society open science	R Soc Open Sci	['eng']

Because e-waste contains a variety of metals, information about those metals with the potential for substantial environmental impact should be provided to manufacturers, recyclers, and disposers to proactively reduce this impact. This study assesses the resource and toxicity (i.e., cancer, noncancer, and ecotoxicity) potentials of various heavy metals commonly found in e-waste from laptop computers, liquid-crystal display (LCD) monitors, LCD TVs, plasma TVs, color cathode ray tube (CRT) TVs, and cell phones and then evaluates such potentials using life cycle impact-based methods. Resource potentials derive primarily from Cu, Sb, Ag, and Pb. Toxicity potentials derive primarily from Pb, Ni, and Hg for cancer toxicity; from Pb, Hg, Zn, and As for noncancer toxicity; and from Cu, Pb, Hg, and Zn for ecotoxicity. Therefore, managing these heavy metals should be a high priority in the design, recycling, and disposal stages of electronic devices.']	('Woo', 'Seung H')	Integrated environmental assessment and management	Integr Environ Assess Manag	['eng']

['Lymphedema is a debilitating progressive condition that severely restricts quality of life and is frequently observed after cancer surgery. The mechanism underlying lymphedema development remains poorly understood, and no effective pharmacological means to prevent or alleviate the ailment is currently available. Using a mouse model of lymphedema, we show here that excessive generation of immature lymphatic vessels is essential for initial edema development and that this early process is also important for later development of lymphedema pathology. We found that CD4(+) T cells interact with macrophages to promote lymphangiogenesis, and that both lymphangiogenesis and edema were greatly reduced in macrophage-depleted mice, lymphocyte-deficient Rag2(?/?) mice or CD4(+) T-cell-deficient mice. Mechanistically, T helper type 1 and T helper type 17 cells activate lesional macrophages to produce vascular endothelial growth factor-C, which promotes lymphangiogenesis, and inhibition of this mechanism suppressed not only early lymphangiogenesis, but also later development of lymphedema. Finally, we show that atorvastatin suppresses excessive lymphangiogenesis and lymphedema by inhibiting T helper type 1 and T helper type 17 cell activation. These results demonstrate that the interaction between CD4(+) T cells and macrophages is a potential therapeutic target for prevention of lymphedema after surgery.']	('Ogata', 'Fusa')	The Journal of investigative dermatology	J.

27014656	2016	11	The impact of obesity towards prostate diseases.	['Evidence has supported obesity as a risk factor for both benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer (PCa). Obesity causes several mechanisms including increased intra-abdominal pressure, altered endocrine status, increased sympathetic nervous activity, increased inflammation process, and oxidative stress, all of which are favorable in the development of BPH. In PCa, there are several different mechanisms, such as decreased serum testosterone, peripheral aromatization of androgens, insulin resistance, and altered adipokine secretion caused by inflammation, which may precipitate the development of and even cause high-grade PCa. The role of obesity in prostatitis still remains unclear.

27014559	2015	11	Evaluation of uptake and distribution of gold nanoparticles in solid tumors.	['Although nanotherapeutics offer a targeted and potentially less toxic alternative to systemic chemotherapy in cancer treatment, nanotherapeutic transport is typically hindered by abnormal characteristics of tumor tissue. Once nanoparticles targeted to tumor cells arrive in the circulation of tumor vasculature, they must extravasate from irregular vessels and diffuse through the tissue to ideally reach all malignant cells in cytotoxic concentrations. The enhanced permeability and retention effect can be leveraged to promote extravasation of appropriately sized particles from tumor vasculature; however, therapeutic success remains elusive partly due to inadequate intra-tumoral transport promoting heterogeneous nanoparticle uptake and distribution. Irregular tumor vasculature not only hinders particle transport but also sustains hypoxic tissue kregions with quiescent cells, which may be unaffected by cycle-dependent chemotherapeutics released from nanoparticles and thus regrow tumor tissue following nanotherapy. Furthermore, a large proportion of systemically injected nanoparticles may become sequestered by the reticuloendothelial system, resulting in overall diminished efficacy. We review recent work evaluating the uptake and distribution of gold nanoparticles in pre-clinical tumor models, with the goal to help improve nanotherapy outcomes. We also examine the potential role of novel layered gold nanoparticles designed to address some of these critical issues, assessing their uptake and transport in cancerous tissue.']	('England', 'Christopher G')	European physical journal plus	Eur Phys J Plus	['eng']

The data set was split into 65 molecules as the training set and 16 compounds as the test set. All descriptors were generated by using the GRid INdependent descriptors (GRIND) approach. After variable selection, GRIND were correlated with activity values (pIC50) by PLS regression. Of the two applied variable selection methods, ERM had a noticeable improvement on the statistical parameters of PLS model, and yielded a q (2) value of 0.77, an [Formula: see text] of 0.94, and a low RMSEP value of 0.25.

['Natural killer T-cells, with an invariant T-cell antigen receptor ?-chain (iNKT cells), are unique and conserved subset of lymphocytes capable of altering the immune system through their rapid and potent cytokine responses. They are reactive to lipid antigens presented by the CD1d molecule, an antigen-presenting molecule that is not highly polymorphic. iNKT cell responses frequently involve mixtures of cytokines that work against each other, and therefore attempts are underway to develop synthetic antigens that elicit only strong interferon-gamma (IFN?) or only strong interleukin-4 responses but not both. Strong IFN? responses may correlate with tighter binding to CD1d and prolonged stimulation of iNKT cells, and this may be useful for vaccine adjuvants and for stimulating anti-tumor responses. iNKT cells are self-reactive although the structure of the endogenous antigen is controversial. By contrast, bacterial and fungal lipids that engage the T-cell receptor and activate IFN? from iNKT cells have been identified from both pathogenic and commensal organisms and the responses are in some cases highly protective from pathogens in mice. It is possible that the expanding knowledge of iNKT cell antigens and iNKT cell activation will provide the basis for therapies for patients suffering from infectious and immune diseases and cancer.']	('Birkholz', 'Alysia M')	Biomedical journal	Biomed J	['eng']

"[""Luteolin (3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxyflavones), a major dietary flavone, regulates a variety of biological effects including cancer progression, insulin resistance and inflammation. However, its exact actions on adipogenesis and osteogenesis and the underlying molecular mechanisms are yet to be clarified. In this study, we show that luteolin suppresses lipid accumulation but increases osteoblast differentiation. In mechanism studies, luteolin increases the expression of the heat shock proteins (Hsp) 40 (Dnajb1) and Hsp90 (Hsp90b1), but not those of other heat shock proteins including Hsp20, Hsp27, Hsp47, Hsp70, Hsp72, and Hsp90, and another type of Hsp40 (Dnaja1). Silencing Dnajb1 by using small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), but not against Hsp90b1, recapitulates the effects of luteolin in adipocyte and osteoblast differentiation. Consistently, the forced expression of Dnajb1 decreases the lipid accumulation and stimulates alkaline phosphatase (ALPL) activity. The antiadipogenic and proosteogenic effects of luteolin are significantly blunted in Dnajb1-deficient cells, further suggesting that Dnajb1 is, at least in part, required for luteolin's dual actions in adipogenesis and osteogenesis. Together, our data implicate luteolin as an ingredient and Dnajb1 as a molecular target for the development of functional foods and drugs in metabolic and bone-related diseases.""]"	('Kwon', 'So-Mi')	The Journal of nutritional biochemistry	J.

['Sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) remains the gold standard for assessing axillary node status in breast cancer. Preoperative scintigrams have been used to identify the sentinel lymph node (SLN); however, their use is controversial.

They have been associated with high false negatives, time expense, patient dissatisfaction, and unnecessary costs. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of scintigrams in comparison to intraoperative SLN identification techniques. This study included all patients undergoing a SLNB for breast cancer from April 2010 to 2011. Scintigram reports, operation notes, and histology results were analyzed. Mann-Whitney U and chi-squared tests were used for statistical analysis of data. Two hundred nineteen female patients with a median age of 59.6\xa0years (24.0-89.9\xa0years) were included in this study. Scintigram was performed in 185 and not in 34 patients due to time constraints.

Surgery represents the treatment of choice, and cases of advanced or recurrent vulvar cancers are to date a major challenge to multidisciplinary teams. Abdominoperineal excision (APE) in combination with vulvectomy and inguinal lymphadenectomy is the only curative treatment option. Patients' files of all women with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva who underwent abdominoperineal resection were retrospectively reviewed with special regards to technical challenges the general surgeon will face. Seven women were enrolled in this retrospective study with a median age of 71\xa0years (range 56-79\xa0years). In six patients, the pelvic floor after abdominoperineal excision could be closed by direct suture of the levator muscles. One woman underwent abdominoperineal resection with closure of the defect using a vertical rectus abdominis myocutaneous (VRAM) flap. All women underwent radical vulvectomy, in five patients in combination with bilateral inguinal lymph node dissection. Operation time was 377\xa0min (range 130-505\xa0min). The median overall survival after surgery was 27\xa0months (range 4-84\xa0months), with a calculated 5-year survival rate of 42\xa0%. Women with negative lymph nodes revealed a longer survival time after surgery compared to women with lymph node metastases (15.5 vs. 72\xa0months; p\u2009=\u20090.09). Abdominoperineal excisions represent a powerful tool in the multidisciplinary treatment regimen of advanced or recurrent vulvar cancer. Reconstruction of the pelvic floor usually does not require myocutaneous flaps, even when facing large tumours. Despite high complication rates, radical surgery was a feasible treatment with long-term survival potential without mortality.""]"	('Hannes', 'Sabine')	The Indian journal of surgery	Indian J Surg	['eng']
27011547	2015	04	Association Between Time (Initiation and Length) and Oncological Outcomes for the Patients with Colon Cancer Treated with Adjuvant Chemotherapy.	"[""Adjuvant chemotherapy is benefit for high-risk stage II and stage III colon cancer after curative resection. But, the optimal time between surgical and initiation of adjuvant chemotherapy remains unclear. Moreover, no study of efficacy with different lengths of adjuvant chemotherapy has appeared. This study was aimed to identify association between time (initiation and length) and oncological outcomes of adjuvant chemotherapy on the stages II and III colon cancer patients. A total of 406 high-risk stages II and III colon cancer patients were retrospectively enrolled in prospectively collected data. They were categorized into three groups representing chemotherapy initiation time: less than 4\xa0weeks (group 1), 4 to 6\xa0weeks (group 2), and more than 6\xa0weeks (group 3). They were categorized into two groups representing chemotherapy length time : less than 200\xa0days (group 1a) and more than 200\xa0days (group 2a). The 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 74.97\xa0% in group 1, 76.94\xa0% in group 2, and 63.97\xa0% in group 3 (p\u2009>\u20090.05).

"[""The liver is the major site of metastasis of primary colorectal cancer. Hepatic resection (HR) is considered the standard treatment for colorectal liver metastasis. In high-risk cases, radiofrequency ablation (RFA) can be attempted as an alternative treatment. This study compared the clinical profiles and overall and disease-free survival rates of patients with colorectal liver metastasis undergoing HR and RFA. From 1995 to 2009, we retrospectively analyzed clinical experiences of 43 and 17 patients who had undergone HR and RFA for primary colorectal cancer, respectively. To compare outcomes, we investigated the 3-year overall and disease-free survival rates. The 3-year overall survival rates of patients treated with HR and RFA were 53.5 and 47.1\xa0%, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.285); the disease-free survival rates were 35.0 and 26.9\xa0%, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.211). In the HR and RFA groups, 30 (60.2\xa0%) and 13 (76.5\xa0%) patients developed recurrence, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.604). In the HR group, 1 patient died from postoperative liver failure, and 9 (20.9\xa0%) developed postoperative complications, including wound infection, biliary leakage, intra-abdominal abscess, and pneumonia. In the RFA group, 1 patient (5.9\xa0%) required prolonged inpatient care because of a procedure-related liver abscess. Although HR should be considered the first option for colorectal liver metastasis, RFA can be regarded as a primary treatment modality depending on the patient's characteristics, especially when a patient refuses surgery or has comorbidities.""]"	('Kim', 'Woon-Won')	The Indian journal of surgery	Indian J Surg	['eng']

['During surgery for colorectal cancer, the inferior mesenteric artery (IMA) may be ligated either directly at the origin of the IMA from the aorta (high ligation) or at a point just below the origin of the left colic artery (low ligation). Sixty patients of left colonic and rectal cancer undergoing elective curative surgery in 2007 and 2008 were selected for this observational study. The resected lymph nodes were grouped into three levels: along the bowel wall (D1), along IMA below left colic (D2), and along the IMA and its root (D3). Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS version 20.0. D2 level was involved pathologically in 20 (33.3\xa0%) and D3 in six out of 44 (13.6\xa0%) patients. The median nodal yield with high and low ligation were 33 and 25, respectively (p\u2009=\u20090.048). Median overall survival for high ligation was 62\xa0months versus 42\xa0months for low ligation (p\u2009=\u20090.190). High ligation of the IMA for rectal and left colonic cancers can improve lymph node yield, thus facilitating accurate tumor staging and thus better disease prognostication, but the survival benefit is not significant.']	('Charan', 'Ishwar')	The Indian journal of surgery	Indian J Surg	['eng']

We performed a retrospective analysis of medical records of patients who were treated at our centre for Paget's disease of the breast from 2006-2011. Twenty patients were treated in this period. Twelve patients had associated lump and eight patients did not have a lump in the breast. Two patients did not have a lump or any detected abnormality in mammography. Multicentricity was present in five patients. Diagnosis of malignancy was made by fine-needle aspiration cytology for patients with palpable lump and nipple wedge biopsy for patients with no lump. Modified radical mastectomy was done in 10 patients: 2 patients underwent total mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy and 8 patients underwent central quadrantectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy. Eleven patients had invasive ductal carcinoma, one patient had ductal carcinoma in situ with foci of invasion and eight patients had ductal carcinoma in situ. Seven patients had lymph node metastases. Three patients had recurrence, one had local recurrence and two had distant recurrences. The mean follow up period was 28\xa0months (range 15-64\xa0months).

['Breast cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in women with the incidence rising in young women. GST gene polymorphisms are significant because of their role in the detoxification of both environmental carcinogens and also cytotoxic drugs used in therapy for breast cancer. The present study has been designed to identify the role of polymorphisms in GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes in the risk of development of breast cancer, in the prognostication of breast cancer, and in the prediction of response towards chemotherapy. Ninety-nine patients with breast cancer and 100 healthy controls with no history of cancer were taken from blood donors after informed consent. Epidemiological and clinical data was collected from participants and 5\xa0ml of peripheral venous blood was collected for genotype analysis. Null genotype of GSTT1 was detected in 51.04\xa0% of the controls in comparison to 20.2\xa0% of patients with carcinoma breast, which was found to be statistically significant (OR 4.18; 95\xa0% CI 2.01-8.75; P\u2009=\u20090.0001). GSTM1 gene deletion was also significantly more common among controls (60\xa0%) than in patients with breast cancer (33\xa0%) (OR 4.57; 95\xa0% CI 2.20-9.51; P\u2009=\u20090.0001). Tumors more than 5\xa0cm in size had greater tendency for GSTM1 gene expression (P value\u2009=\u20090.019), but other clinicopathological parameters did not show any correlation. GSTT1 and GSTM1 genes status did not show any association with response to chemotherapy. The results indicated the null genotype of both GSTT1 and GSTM1 to be protective for the development of carcinoma breast. None of the known etiological factors have any correlation with GSTT1 and GSTM1 gene deletion. Patients with small tumor size expressed GSTM1 gene deletion. Other tumor characteristics and clinicopathological parameters did not have any correlation with gene deletion.']	('Bansal', 'Virinder Kumar')	The Indian journal of surgery	Indian J Surg	['eng']

Lately there has been an increased incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma. The aim of the present work was to study neoangiogenesis in esophageal adenocarcinomas. The study was conducted on 40 cases diagnosed and surgically treated. Subsequently, fragment processing was performed using various immunohistochemical staining and marking with CD34 and p53 antigen. Later, quantitative measurements were performed, and images were taken using a microscope imaging system. In the end of the procedures, the professional program PRODIT 5.2. was applied. The study of the vascular system in the esophageal epithelial tumors revealed an axis consisting of three elements which have a mutual induction process: inflammatory infiltrate-neoangiogenesis-fibrosis, with significant differences between the three degrees of differentiation. A significant increase in tumor micro vascular density was present together with the increasing of the histological grading, with an inverse correlation with the degree of differentiation and directly proportional to the risk of malignancy.']	('Ardeleanu', 'Valeriu')	The Indian journal of surgery	Indian J Surg	['eng']
27011492	2015	05	The Effect of Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone on Tumor Size in Differentiated Thyroid Carcinoma.	"['We evaluated the correlation between serum thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels and tumor size and other invasiveness parameters of tumor in patients with differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC). Several clinical studies have reported that TSH may also have a role as a regulator of the development and function of the thyroid gland. It is currently not clear whether TSH is involved in the existence of thyroid cancer or progression of thyroid cancer or both. Patients with DTC who underwent thyroid surgery between 2003 and 2008 were included this study. Preoperative serum T3, T4, and TSH levels were compared with the size and invasiveness of cancer, retrospectively. DTC was observed in 110 patients over the 5-year period. Seventy-seven (70\xa0%) of them were euthyroid and classified as the ""normal-TSH group"" (NTG), and 33 (30\xa0%) have an overt or subclinical hyperthyroidism, classified as the ""low-TSH group"" (LTG). The mean tumor diameter in the LTG was found to be 8.91\u2009±\u20098.03\xa0mm; however, it was found to be 18.19\u2009±\u200916.24\xa0mm in the NTG. There were significantly differences among the groups related to the diameter of tumor (p\u2009=\u20090.001). Microcarcinoma was determined in 36 patients (46.8\xa0%) in the NTG and 23 patients (69.7\xa0%) in the LTG (p\u2009=\u20090.027). Although there were no significant differences, tumor capsule invasion (33.8 vs. 18.2\xa0%, p\u2009=\u20090.099) and lymphovascular invasion (16.9 vs. 6.1\xa0%, p\u2009=\u20090.130) rates were higher in the NTG. These findings suggest that TSH has effects on growing and proliferation of not only normal thyroid cells but also cancer cells in DTC. This study revealed that serum TSH level can be explored as an important factor that affects the size and invasiveness of tumor in DTC.']"	('Ozemir', 'I A')	The Indian journal of surgery	Indian J Surg	['eng']

['There is very little awareness of the general physicians and surgeons about the benign breast conditions such as duct ectasia (DE) and periductal mastitis (PDM) causing nipple discharge. Not only that these benign breast diseases ring a false alarm of cancer, they are also the second most common cause of benign breast diseases. The objective was to study the clinical and microbiological profiles of duct ectasia and periductal mastitis in Indian women for better understanding of the disease process, in order to be able to treat them well. Forty-one consecutive patients presenting to the Surgical Out-Patient Department with non-bloody nipple discharge with clinical and radiological features suggestive of DE or PDM were included. Microbial culture and cytopathological study of the nipple discharge were done. Histopathological studies and culture of the ductal tissue taken intraoperatively were carried out. There is no significant difference in the age distribution among women with DE and PDM. Smoking is not associated with DE and PDM of Indian patients in contrast to the Western literature evidence. Infective etiology was present in nearly 46\xa0% of the patients in the study population more so in the periductal mastitis cases. The most common isolated pathogens were Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, unlike in Western population where nearly 50\xa0% were anaerobes. Since the isolated organisms were resistant to the routinely used antibiotics in high proportion of cases, culture and sensitivity should be done in all possible cases for appropriately treating the subareolar sepsis before proceeding with the definitive treatment in the form of duct excision.']	('Ramalingam', 'Kirithiga')	The Indian journal of surgery	Indian J Surg	['eng']

Twelve (30\xa0%) patients underwent laparoscopic radical resections (seven AR and five APER) post-TEM. Post-operative histology confirmed pT0N0 in 7/12 patients. Three were lymph node-positive (T0N1), one was pT3N1 and the fifth was pT3N2. TEM is associated with quicker recovery, shorter hospital stay and fewer complications than radical surgery. It is a good alternative to radical surgery in early rectal cancer, especially for high-risk patients.

Surgical management is the mainstay of initial treatment for majority of patients. Minimally invasive surgery has gained acceptance for the surgical treatment of rectal cancer because, compared with laparotomy, it is associated with fewer complications, shorter hospitalization, and faster recovery. The aim of this study is to evaluate the safety, feasibility, technique, and outcomes (postoperative, oncological, and functional) of robotic-assisted rectal surgery in comparison with open surgery in the Indian population. A prospective randomized study was undertaken from August 2011 to December 2012. Fifty patients who presented with rectal carcinoma were randomized to either robotic arm (RA) or open arm (OA) group. Both groups were matched for clinical stage and operation type. Technique and feasibility of robotic-assisted surgery in terms of operating time, estimated blood loss, margins status, total number of lymph nodes retrieved, hospital stay, conversion to open procedure, complications, and functional outcomes were analyzed. The mean operative time was significantly longer in the RA than in the OA group (310 vs 246\xa0min, P\u2009<\u20090.001) but was significantly reduced in the latter part of the robotic-assisted patients compared with the initial patients. The mean estimated blood loss was significantly less in the RA compared with the OA group (165.14 vs 406.04\xa0ml, P\u2009<\u20090.001). None of the patients had margin positivity. The mean distal resection margin was significantly longer in the RA than in the OA group (3.6 vs 2.4\xa0cm, P\u2009<\u20090.001). A total of 100\xa0% of patients in the RA group had complete mesorectal excision while two patients in the OA group had incomplete mesorectal excision. The average number of retrieved lymph nodes was adequate for accurate staging. The number of lymph nodes removed by robotic method is slightly higher than the open method (16.88 vs 15.20) but with no statistical significance. Conversion rate was nil. The mean hospital stay was significantly shorter in the RA group (7.52 vs 13.24\xa0days, P\u2009<\u20090.001). Postoperative and functional outcomes were comparable between the two groups.

['The Antarctic is a potentially important library of microbial resources and new bioactive substances. In this study, microorganisms were isolated from surface water samples collected from different sites of the Antarctic. 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay-based cytotoxicity-tracking method was used to identify Antarctic marine microorganism resources for antitumor lead compounds. The results showed that a total of 129 Antarctic microorganism strains were isolated. Twelve strains showed potent cytotoxic activities, among which a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium, designated as N11-8 was further studied. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence showed that N11-8 belongs to the genus Bacillus. Fermented active products of N11-8 with molecular weights of 1-30 kDa had higher inhibitory effects on different cancaer cells, such as BEL-7402 human hepatocellular carcinoma cells, U251 human glioma cells, RKO human colon carcinoma cells, A549 human lung carcinoma cells, and MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells. However, they displayed lower cytotoxicity against HFL1 human normal fibroblast lung cells. However, they displayed lower cytotoxicity against HFL1 human normal fibroblast lung cells. Microscopic observations showed that the fermented active products have inhibitory activity on BEL-7402 cells similar to that of mitomycin C. Further studies indicated that the fermented active products have high pH and high thermal stability. In conclusion, most strains isolated in this study may be developed as promising sources for the discovery of antitumor bioactive substances.

['?-Tocopheryl succinate (?-TOS) is a well-known mitochondrially targeted anticancer compound. However, the major factor limiting the use of ?-TOS is its low solubility in physiological media. To overcome this problem, the aim of this work is the preparation of new polymeric and active ?-TOS-based nanovehicle with a precise control over its macromolecular architecture. Reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer polymerization (RAFT) is used to synthesize an ?-TOS amphiphilic block copolymer with highly homogeneous molecular weight and relatively narrow dispersity. Macro-chain transfer agents (macro-CTA) based on poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) of different molecular weights (MW, ranging from 4.6 to 20 kDa) are used to obtain block copolymers with different hydrophilic/hydrophobic ratios with PEG being the hydrophilic block and a methacrylic derivative of ?-tocopheryl succinate (MTOS) being the monomer that formed the hydrophobic block. PEG-b-poly(MTOS) form spherical nanoparticles (NPs) by self-organized precipitation (SORP) or solvent exchange in aqueous media enabling to encapsulate and deliver hydrophobic molecules in their core. The resulting NPs are rapidly endocytosed by cancer cells. The biological activity of the synthesized NPs are found to depend on the MW of PEG, with NP comprised of the higher MW copolymer resulting in the lower bioactivity due to PEG shielding inhibiting cellular uptake by endocytosis. Moreover, the biological activity also depends on the MTOS content, as the biological activity increases as a function of MTOS concentration.']	('Palao-Suay', 'Raquel')	Polymer chemistry	Polym Chem	['eng']

['Pancreatic carcinoma is an aggressive disease and radiotherapy treatment delivery to the primary tumor is constrained by the anatomical close location of the duodenum, stomach, and small bowel. Duodenal dose tolerance for radiosurgery in 2-5 fractions has been largely unknown. The literature was surveyed for quantitative models of risk in 1-5 fractions and we analyzed our own patient population of 44 patients with unresectable pancreatic tumors who received 3 or 5 fractions of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) between March 2009 and March 2013. A logistic model was constructed in the dose-volume histogram (DVH) Evaluator software for the duodenal D50%, D30cc, D5cc, D1cc, and maximum point dose D0.035cc. Dose tolerance limits from the literature were overlaid onto the clinical duodenal data in the form of a DVH Risk Map, with risk levels of the published limits estimated from the model of clinical data. In 3 fractions, Kopek 2010 found a statistically significant difference in D1cc of patients with no common terminology criteria for adverse events (CTCAE) v3 grade 2 or higher duodenal complications (mean D1cc = 25.3Gy) as compared with patients with grade 2 or higher toxicity (mean D1cc = 37.4Gy). From the logistic model of our duodenal data in 3 fractions, D1cc = 25.3Gy had 4.7% risk of grade 3-4 hemorrhage or stricture and D1cc = 37.4Gy had 20% risk.

['High radiation dose to the main bronchi can result in stenosis, occlusion or fistula formation, and death. Only 8 articles have reported side effects to the main bronchi from stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), mostly with only one symptomatic complication per article. Therefore, we calculated the dose to the bronchial structures, such as trachea; mainstem bronchi; intermediate bronchus; upper-, middle-, and lower-lobe bronchus; and the segmental bronchi in 134 patients with central tumors and calculated the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) for each of these structures, with toxicity determination based upon computed tomography imaging. No side effects were found in the trachea, and only stenosis occurred in the main bronchus and bronchus intermedius. Higher grades of side effects, such as occlusion and atelectasis, were only seen in the upper-, middle-, and lower bronchi and the segmental bronchi. When 0.5cc of a segmental bronchi was irradiated to 50Gy in 5 fractions, it was about 50% likely to be occluded radiographically. For grade 1 radiographically evident side effects, the 50% risk level for a 5-fraction Dmax was 55Gy for mid-bronchi and 65Gy for mainstem bronchi. To assure the relationship between clinical toxicity and side effects to the bronchi, further investigation is needed.']	('Duijm', 'Marloes')	Seminars in radiation oncology	Semin Radiat Oncol	['eng']
27000510	2016	12	Validity of Current Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy Dose Constraints for Aorta and Major Vessels.	['Understanding dose constraints for critical structures in stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is essential to generate a plan for optimal efficacy and safety. Published dose constraints are derived by a variety of methods, including crude statistics, actuarial analysis, modeling, and simple biologically effective dose (BED) conversion. Many dose constraints reported in the literature are not consistent with each other, secondary to differences in clinical and dosimetric parameters. Application of a dose constraint without discriminating the variation of all the factors involved may result in suboptimal treatment. This issue of Seminars in Radiation Oncology validates dose tolerance limits for 10 critical anatomic structures based on dose response modeling of clinical outcomes data to include detailed dose-volume metrics. This article presents a logistic dose-response model for aorta and major vessels based on 238 cases from the literature in addition to 387 cases from MD Anderson Cancer Center at Cooper University Hospital, for a total of 625 cases. The Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) 0813 dose-tolerance limit of Dmax = 52.5Gy in 5 fractions was found to have a 1.2% risk of grade 3-5 toxicity, and the Timmerman 2008 limit of Dmax = 45Gy in 3 fractions had 2.3% risk.

Although these toxicities generally are not life-threatening, the chest wall and ribs are considered dose-limiting tissues because of the potential effect on patients? quality of life. Few studies have reported dose-response models that can provide quantitative estimates of risk as a function of dose and volume. Notably, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (Mutter et al(8)) analyzed grade 2 or higher chest wall toxicity in a cohort of 126 patients treated with linear accelerator-based SBRT; the authors provided detailed dose-volume histogram (DVH) data to allow for pooled analyses. We pooled these 126 patients with an additional 44 patients treated with CyberKnife at the Erlanger Medical Center to create an updated dose-response model for chest wall tolerance. In the aggregate analysis, the 10% risk level for grade 2 or higher complications for D70cc was 16.2Gy in 4 fractions, and the 50% risk level was D70cc = 65.1Gy in 4 fractions. For D2cc, the 10% and 50% risk levels in 4 fractions were 43.0Gy and 87.9Gy, respectively. These dose-tolerance limits may help quantify chest wall toxicity risks.

The purpose of this study was to characterize the risk of esophagitis for patients treated with SBRT and to develop a statistical dose-response model to assess the equivalent uniform dose, D10%, D5cc, D1cc, and Dmax, to the esophagus and the risk of toxicity. Toxicity outcomes of a dose-escalation study of 56 patients who had taken CyberKnife treatment from 45-60Gy in 3-7 fractions at the Erasmus MC-Daniel den Hoed Cancer Center were utilized to create the dose-response model for esophagus. A total of 5 grade 2 esophageal complications were reported (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0); 4 complications were early effects and 1 complication was a late effect. All analyses were performed in terms of 5-fraction equivalent dosing. According to our study, D1cc at a dose of 32.9Gy and Dmax dose of 43.4Gy corresponded to a complication probability of 50% for grade 2 toxicity. In this series of 58 CyberKnife mediastinal lung cases, no grade 3 or higher esophageal toxicity occurred. Our estimates of esophageal toxicity are compared with the data in the literature. Further research needs to be performed to establish more reliable dose limits as longer follow-up and toxicity outcomes are reported in patients treated with SBRT for central lung lesions.']	('Nuyttens', 'Joost J')	Seminars in radiation oncology	Semin Radiat Oncol	['eng']

['Stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) with concomitant cetuximab is an effective treatment option for previously irradiated, locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Its local control and overall survival are similar to those of other available treatment options. Each retreatment depends heavily on the prior treatment and every patient is a special case. Based on the experience of our institution and previously published studies, for patients who receive concomitant cetuximab with a median prior radiation therapy dose of 70Gy, we recommend a total dose of 40-44Gy delivered in 5 fractions on alternating days over 1-2 weeks. However, Grade 2 or 3 toxicities are not uncommon. Therefore, in this review, we also report a pilot study that applies a normal tissue complication probability dose-response model to estimate the probability of toxicities in locally recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck reirradiated with SABR. Although this dose-response model includes concurrent targeted therapy and no comparable model yet exists for SABR without it, complication rates without concurrent biological therapy or chemotherapy should be no higher than those described here.']	('Quan', 'Kimmen')	Seminars in radiation oncology	Semin Radiat Oncol	['eng']

['Radiation oncologists need reliable estimates of risk for various fractionation schemes for all critical anatomical structures throughout the body, in a clinically convenient format.

The graphical portion of the DVH Risk Map helps clinicians to easily visualize the trends, whereas the tabular portion provides quantitative precision for clinical implementation. The DVH Risk Map for rib tolerance from stereotactic ablative body radiotherapy (SABR) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is used as an example in this overview; the 5% and 50% risk levels for 1-5 fractions for 5 different volumes are given.

26998301	2016	12	Differences and correlation of serum CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 in gastric cancer.	"[""The sensitivity of three biomarkers, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9 and CA72-4, in combination has been identified to be greater than that of any of the biomarkers considered in isolation in cases of gastric cancer (GC). However, the fundamental cause underlying this phenomenon remains to be fully elucidated. In the present study, the differences and correlation of these three biomarkers were investigated in patients with GC in order to determine how the three biomarkers in combination work more effectively compared with any of the biomarkers considered alone. The serum levels of CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 of 216 patients with gastric adenocarcinoma were analyzed on admission to hospital. The differences in positive rates and the serum levels of CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 were analyzed using the ?2 test and the non-parametric Wilcoxon two-sample test. Phi (f) correlation analysis was used to study the correlation among the expression (positive or not) levels of CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4. The correlation among the serum levels of biomarkers was analyzed using Spearman's test. The results demonstrated that the combined positive rate of CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 was significantly higher compared with the individual CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 positive rates (44.91% vs. 22.69, 18.98 and 22.69%, respectively; all P<0.05). The positive rate of CA19-9 and CA72-4 in the extent of the primary tumor/involvement of regional lymph node/distant metastases (TNM)-III/IV stage subgroup was higher compared with that in the TNM-I/II subgroup (?2=5.902, P=0.015; ?2=8.009, P=0.005), although not the positive rate of CEA (?2=0.302, P=0.583). A significant correlation was identified between the expression level of CEA and CA72-4 (f correlation coefficient=0.182; P=0.008) and between that of CA19-9 and CA72-4 (f correlation coefficient=0.189; P=0.006), although not between that of CEA and CA19-9 (f correlation coefficient=0.048; P=0.482) in the total number of patients with GC. A significant correlation was also identified between the serum levels of CEA and CA19-9, of CEA and CA72-4 and of CA19-9 and CA72-4 (Spearman's correlation coefficient=0.231, -0.271 and 0.167; P=0.001, P<0.0001 and P=0.014, respectively). The present study indicated that there was only a weak correlation between the positive rate of CEA and CA72-4 and between that of CA19-9 and CA72-4, and no correlation was identified between the positive rate of CEA and CA19-9, even if a correlation was identified between the serum levels of the biomarkers. The present study suggested that the evidence that the sensitivity of the three biomarkers in combination is greater than that of any of the biomarkers taken in isolation is due to less co-presentation of CEA, CA19-9 and CA72-4 in patients with GC.""]"	('Yu', 'Junxiu')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

['The aim of the present study was to evaluate the efficacy of erlotinib, one of the epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs), in patients undergoing dose reduction and in those with a low body surface area (BSA). The association between dose reduction, low BSA and efficacy, including response rate, disease control rate, time to treatment failure and overall survival, were evaluated in patients prescribed first-line erlotinib for EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer patients between April 2012 and March 2015. A total of 22 patients received first-line erlotinib during the study period. A dose reduction of erlotinib for the reason of low BSA and poor performance status occurred in 14 (63.6%) of the patients: 6 (27.3%) had initial dose reduction, 6 (27.3%) had dose reduction in their clinical courses, and 2 (9.1%) had both. Dose reduction of erlotinib with the initial dose of erlotinib/BSA was >80 mg/m2, and longest-term prescribed dose of erlotinib/BSA was >50 mg/m2, which may have no association with a survival disadvantage. Dose-reduction estimation studies for TKIs may be crucial, particularly for patients with a low BSA. Future prospective studies and confirmation of these results in population-based retrospective ones investigating the incidence of dose reduction in patients with AEs and those with low BSA may be required for the efficient use of erlotinib in common clinical practice.']	('Inagaki', 'Masaharu')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

Patients with advanced or recurrent CRC were treated with standard MEC regimens (FOLFOX, XELOX or FOLFIRI) and received either standard chemotherapy [5-hydroxytryptamine-3 receptor antagonist (5-HT3RA) + dexamethasone] or aprepitant regimen chemotherapy (5-HT3 RA + reduced-dose dexamethasone + aprepitant). The primary endpoint of the present study was the proportion of patients who achieved a complete response (CR) during the overall, acute, and delayed phases of the first planned chemotherapy cycle. Secondary endpoints were complete protection, the proportions of patients without emetic episodes or nausea, patients with no more than moderate nausea during the overall, acute and delayed phases, and the time to treatment failure. The CR rates in the overall, acute and delayed phases were similar in the aprepitant and the standard-regimen groups.

The specific immunohistochemical characteristics of the stromal component according to the breast carcinoma subtype surrogates of molecular classes is poorly understood. In the present study, immunohistochemical staining was used to evaluate the expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), which is one of the most important proteins considered to facilitate tumor invasion, in a series of invasive breast carcinomas according to subtype: Luminal A, luminal B, luminal-HER2, HER2-enriched and triple-negative. A significant increase in MMP2 expression was demonstrated in tumors known to exhibit a more aggressive metastatic behavior, such as luminal HER2 (37%), HER2-enriched (30%) and triple-negative tumors (17%), compared with the luminal A (6%) or luminal B (13%) subtypes. Our data indicated that the CAFs associated with different breast subtypes exhibit different specific properties to facilitate tumor invasion.']	('Catteau', 'Xavier')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

['For proper determination of the apoptotic potential of chemoxenobiotics in synergism, it is important to understand the modes, levels and character of interactions of chemoxenobiotics with cells in the context of predicted conserved biophysical properties. Chemoxenobiotic structures are studied with respect to atom distribution over molecular space, the predicted overall octanol-to-water partition coefficient (Log OWPC; unitless) and molecular size viz a viz van der Waals diameter (vdWD). The Log OWPC-to-vdWD (nm-1 ) parameter is determined, and where applicable, hydrophilic interacting moiety/core-to-vdWD (nm-1 ) and lipophilic incorporating hydrophobic moiety/core-to-vdWD (nm-1 ) parameters of their part-structures are determined. The cellular and sub-cellular level interactions of the spectrum of xenobiotic chemotherapies have been characterized, for which a classification system has been developed based on predicted conserved biophysical properties with respect to the mode of chemotherapeutic effect. The findings of this study are applicable towards improving the effectiveness of existing combination chemotherapy regimens and the predictive accuracy of personalized cancer treatment algorithms as well as towards the selection of appropriate novel xenobiotics with the potential to be potent chemotherapeutics for dendrimer nanoparticle-based effective transvascular delivery.']	('Sarin', 'Hemant')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']
26998283	2016	12	Meta-analyses of treatment standards for pancreatic cancer.	['Pancreatic cancer is the most lethal common cancer with an estimated 5-year survival rate of 6-7% (across all stages). The only potential curative therapy is surgical resection in those with localized disease. Adjuvant (postoperative) therapy confers a survival advantage over postoperative observation alone. Neoadjuvant (preoperative) therapy offers the potential to downstage initially unresectable tumors for resection, sterilize resection margins and decrease locoregional recurrence, and identify a subset of patients with aggressive disease for whom surgery will not be beneficial. Induction chemotherapy followed by consolidation chemoradiation is another recommended approach in those with locally advanced disease. For those who cannot be downstaged, cannot tolerate surgery, or were diagnosed with metastatic disease, treatment remains palliative with chemotherapy being a critical component of this approach. Recently, intensive combination chemotherapy has been shown to improve survival rates in comparison to gemcitabine alone in advanced disease. The past few decades have afforded an accumulation of high-level evidence regarding neoadjuvant, adjuvant and palliative therapies in pancreatic cancer. There are numerous reviews discussing recent retrospective studies, prospective studies and randomized controlled trials in each of these areas. However, reviews of optimal and recommended treatment strategies across all stages of pancreatic cancer that focus on the highest levels of hierarchical evidence, such as meta-analyses, are limited. The discussion of novel therapeutics is beyond the scope of this review. However, an extensive and the most current collection of meta-analyses of first-line systemic and locoregional treatment options for all stages of pancreatic cancer to date has been accumulated.']	('Gong', 'Jun')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

['Among colorectal cancers, the prevalence of signet ring cell carcinoma (SRCC) is lower than 1%; to date, only 6 cases of early SRCCs arising in colonic adenoma have been reported. In spite of the well-established understanding of the phenotypic and genetic changes occurring in conventional colonic carcinogenesis, the molecular landscape of colon SRCC is still far to be elucidated. We describe the histologic and immunohistochemical phenotype and the molecular profile of a case of intramucosal SRCC developed within a 4.5-cm large sigmoid adenoma. The DNA sequencing of the 2 microdissected neoplastic components (adenomatous and SRCC) showed the same G12V KRAS mutation. Interestingly, although the adenomatous epithelium showed unequivocal p53 overexpression, no signet ring cancer cells featured p53 nuclear immunostain. This molecular pattern supports the unique histogenesis of the 2 coexisting neoplastic oncotypes, also suggesting that the signet ring cell component is derived from the molecular de-differentiation (p53 loss) of the preexisting adenomatous lesion.']	('Bellan', 'Alberto')	Human pathology	Hum.

['The presence of greater than or equal to 90% necrosis after neoadjuvant chemotherapy is a favorable prognostic factor in osteosarcomas. A recent study using tissue microarrays of 40 conventional osteosarcomas showed that p16 expression independently predicted the necrotic response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. In this study, we investigated this finding using whole sections in a larger group of osteosarcomas. Cases of 83 patients who had pretreatment biopsies and received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and surgical resection were collected from 3 reference hospital archives. Age, sex, tumor size, tumor subtype, location, and percentage of tumor necrosis were recorded; 4-?m sections from pretreatment biopsies were stained for p16. More than 30% strong nuclear staining was regarded as positive. The median age was 17 years (5-68 years), and male/female ratio was 2.3. The mean tumor diameter was 9.9 cm (2-30 cm). Tumors were most commonly of the osteoblastic type (60%) and located at the femur (47%). p16 positivity was seen in 66% of the patients. The median pathologic necrosis was 65%, and 39% of the patients responded favorably (?%90 necrosis) to neoadjuvant therapy. In univariate analysis, p16 expression significantly correlated with greater than or equal to 90% response (P = .022). On multivariate analysis, p16 expression (odds ratio [OR], 7.71; P = .008), female sex (OR, 8.62; P = .006), and smaller tumor size (OR, 0.86; P = .023) were independent predictors of favorable response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

['Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 3 (MAP3K3) is ubiquitously expressed in numerous tissues and is activated by various extracellular stimuli to regulate processes, such as cell proliferation and differentiation. Recent studies have identified potentially pathologic conditions of MAP3K3 as an oncogene that promotes tumor progression and metastasis in a number of malignancies. However, the clinical significance of MAP3K3 expression in ovarian carcinoma (OC) remains unclear. In this study, the correlation between MAP3K3 expression and OC prognosis was assessed by immunohistochemistry. MAP3K3 overexpression was observed in 59.1% (55/93) of OCs and was significantly associated with histological type and grade, chemotherapy response, and challenge model (P < .05, respectively). MAP3K3 overexpression was also used as an independent prognostic marker for decreased disease-free survival and overall survival. In OC cell lines, MAP3K3 expression was evaluated by Western blot analysis, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction, and immunofluorescence. High MAP3K3 expression is significantly detected in SKOV3, C13*, and A2780 cells. All these findings suggested that MAP3K3 overexpression is an independent poor prognostic indicator of OC and can be a clinically effective biomarker of OC.']	('Jia', 'Wei')	Human pathology	Hum.

This study investigated the role of the SHH signaling pathway in PJS. Expression of SHH, PTCH, and GLI1 was examined by real-time PCR and immunohistochemistry in 20 normal tissues and 75 colorectal lesions (25 PJPs, 25 adenomas, and 25 adenocarcinomas). Expression of SHH, PTCH, and GLI1 mRNA was higher in PJPs than in normal tissue (P < .05) and gradually increased along the PJP-adenoma-adenocarcinoma sequence (P < .05). Immunostaining indicated that SHH expression was present in 60% of PJPs, 72% of adenomas, and 84% of carcinomas, whereas 68% of PJPs, 72% of adenomas, and 88% of carcinomas exhibited cytoplasmic expression of PTCH. Moreover, high GLI1 expression was detected in 56% of PJPs, 64% of adenomas, and 80% of carcinomas; and high nuclear expression of GLI1 was observed in 8 adenomas with atypia and 15 carcinomas. Increased SHH, PTCH, and GLI1 protein correlated positively with tumor grade (P = .012, P = .003, and P = .007, respectively), tumor depth (P = .024, P = .007, and P = .01), and lymph node metastasis (P = .05, P = .015, and P = .005).

['WISP3 is involved in many cancer-related processes including epithelial-mesenchymal transition, cell death, invasion, and metastasis and is considered a tumor suppressor. The aim of our study was to find whether WISP3 gene was mutated and expressionally altered in gastric (GC) and colorectal cancers (CRCs). WISP3 gene possesses a mononucleotide repeat in the coding sequence that could be mutated in cancers with high microsatellite instability (MSI-H). We analyzed 79 GCs and 156 CRCs, and found that GCs (8.8%) and CRCs (10.5%) with MSI-H, but not those with microsatellite stable/low MSI, harbored a frameshift mutation. We also analyzed intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH) of the frameshift mutation in 16 CRCs and found that the WISP3 mutation exhibited regional ITH in 25% of the CRCs. In immunohistochemistry, loss of WISP3 expression was identified in 24% of GCs and 21% of CRCs. The loss of expression was more common in those with WISP3 mutation than with wild-type WISP3 and those with MSI-H than with microsatellite stable/low MSI. Our data indicate that WISP3 harbored not only frameshift mutation but also mutational ITH and loss of expression, which together might play a role in tumorigenesis of GC and CRC with MSI-H by inhibiting tumor suppressor functions of WISP3. Our data also suggest that mutation analysis in multiregions is needed for a proper evaluation of mutation status in GC and CRC with MSI-H.']	('Lee', 'Ju Hwa')	Human pathology	Hum. Pathol.	['eng']

['Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast is staged as pTis regardless of size; however, extent of DCIS correlates with local recurrence rates and likelihood of close or positive margins. As a result, DCIS extent influences patient management and is an important element in the College of American Pathologists tumor summary checklist for excision specimens. There are no recommendations regarding routine reporting of DCIS extent on needle core biopsy material, and to our knowledge, no systematic studies have evaluated the impact of reporting this in biopsy material. Consecutive cases of DCIS performed or reviewed at our institution were identified by pathology report search over a 7-year period. The greatest linear extent of DCIS on core biopsy was compared with the estimated extent in the excision. Of 241 total cases, there were 157 (65%) cases in which the DCIS extent on biopsy was smaller, 13 (5%) cases in which the sizes were equal, and 70 (29%) cases in which the biopsy size was greater, including 30 (12%) with no residual tumor on excision. Mean extent was greater on excision than on core biopsy (16.0 versus 5.7 mm; P < .0001); however, the opposite was seen when only small tumors (? 10 mm final size) were considered (4.5 versus. 3.6 mm; P = .0161). There was strong linear correlation (r = 0.9761; P < .0001) between the size change (excision size minus biopsy size) and final pathologic size.

['Loss of expression of liver fatty acid binding protein (LFABP) by immunohistochemistry has been shown to be characteristic of a subset of hepatocellular adenomas (HCAs) in which HNF1A is inactivated. Transformation to hepatocellular carcinoma is thought to be a very rare phenomenon in the HNF1A-inactivated variant of HCA. However, we recently observed 2 cases at our institution, 1 definite hepatocellular carcinoma and 1 possible hepatocellular carcinoma, with loss of LFABP staining, raising the possibility that LFABP down-regulation may be associated with hepatocellular carcinogenesis. Our aim was to evaluate hepatocellular carcinomas arising in various backgrounds and with varying degrees of differentiation for loss of LFABP staining. Twenty total cases of hepatocellular carcinoma were examined. Thirteen cases arose in a background of cirrhosis due to hepatitis C (n = 8) or steatohepatitis (n = 5); 7 cases arose in a noncirrhotic background, with 2 cases arising within HNF1A-inactivated variant HCA and 2 cases arising within inflammatory variant HCA. Complete loss of expression of LFABP was seen in 6 of 20 cases, including 2 cases of hepatocellular carcinoma arising within HNF1A-inactivated variant HCA. Thus, loss of staining for LFABP appears to be common in hepatocellular carcinoma and may be seen in well-differentiated hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore, LFABP loss should not be interpreted as evidence for hepatocellular adenoma over carcinoma, when other features support a diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma. The findings raise consideration for a role of HNF1A inactivation in hepatocellular carcinogenesis, particularly in less differentiated tumors.']	('Cho', 'Soo-Jin')	Human pathology	Hum. Pathol.

['The 30% of patients whose indolent follicular lymphoma transforms to aggressive diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) have poor survival. Reliable predictors of follicular B-cell lymphoma transformation to DLBCL are lacking, and diagnosis of those that will progress is challenging. MicroRNA, which regulates gene expression, has critical functions in the growth and progression of many cancers and contributes to the pathogenesis of lymphoma. Using 5 paired samples from patients who presented with follicular lymphoma and progressed to DLBCL, we identified specific microRNA differentially expressed between the two. Specifically, miR-17-5p levels were low in follicular lymphoma and increased as the disease transformed. In contrast, miR-31 expression was high in follicular lymphoma and decreased as the lymphoma progressed. These results were confirmed in additional unpaired cases of low-grade follicular lymphoma (n = 13) and high-grade follicular lymphoma grade 3 or DLBCL (n = 17). Loss of miR-31 expression in DLBCL was not due to deletion of the locus. Changes in miR-17-5p and miR-31 were not correlated with immunophenotype, genetics, or status of the MYC oncogene. However, increased miR-17-5p expression did significantly correlate with increased expression of p53 protein, which is indicative of mutant TP53. Two pro-proliferative genes, E2F2 and PI3KC2A, were identified as direct messenger RNA targets of miR-31, suggesting that these may contribute to follicular lymphoma transformation. Our results indicate that changes in miR-31 and miR-17-5p reflect the transformation of follicular lymphoma to an aggressive large B-cell lymphoma and may, along with their targets, be viable markers for this process.']	('Thompson', 'Mary Ann')	Human pathology	Hum.

['Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma (HSTCL) is a rare T-cell lymphoma commonly associated with cytopenias. The pathogenesis of cytopenias in patients with HSTCL is not well defined, although the presence of dyspoietic hematopoietic cells and the common association with trisomy 8 raise the possibility of an associated myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS). In 25 bone marrow specimens involved by HSTCL, we systematically assessed for morphologic features of dyspoiesis and correlated the findings with peripheral cytopenia(s), cytogenetic findings, and detection of chromosome 8 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. The median patient age was 33 years. One patient had a history of MDS diagnosed 1 year prior to the diagnosis of HSTCL. Thirteen (54%) patients had anemia less than 100 g/L, 10 (53%) of 19 had neutropenia less than 1.8 × 10(9)/L, and 15 (60%) had thrombocytopenia less than 100 × 10(9)/L. Dyspoietic features were identified in 1 to 3 hematopoietic cell lineages in 20 (80%) of 25 patients. Cytogenetic analysis identified trisomy 8 in 7 cases. Patients with trisomy 8 had a lower platelet count, but trisomy 8 was not associated with cytopenias, dyspoietic features, or cytogenetic abnormalities. Combined morphologic and fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis showed that trisomy 8 was restricted to the lymphoma cells, except in the 1 patient with a history of MDS. In conclusion, dyspoietic changes are common in the bone marrow of patients with HSTCL. These changes are not associated with cytopenias or chromosomal abnormalities, suggesting that dyspoiesis in patients with HSTCL is not a manifestation of a MDS.']	('Yabe', 'Mariko')	Human pathology	Hum.

Messenger RNA expression of CYP24A1 was further evaluated by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in 12 pairs of fresh frozen CRC samples. CYP24A1 expression was significantly higher in CRC tissues compared to corresponding noncancerous tissues. The expression of CYP24A1 protein in CRC was correlated with the depth of tumor invasion (P = .000), lymph node metastasis (P = .030), venous permeation (P = .016), and overall survival (P = .008). A Kaplan-Meier analysis of the CRC patients with high CYP24A1 expression showed significantly reduced overall survival and disease-free survival compared to the patients with low expression (P = 0.026 and .009). A prognostic significance of CYP24A1 was also found in the subgroup of venous permeation condition classification. A multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that CYP24A1 expression was an independent prognostic factor for CRC recurrence (P = .032).

['Ampullary adenocarcinomas (A-ACs) are rare malignancies with considerable importance because of their high curable resection rate and improved survival rate among periampullary cancers. The RAS-RAF-MAPK pathway is involved in the development of A-ACs and is a potential therapeutic target. However, molecular profiles of A-ACs and their prognostic impact are poorly understood. Peptide nucleic acid-mediated polymerase chain reaction clamping and Mutyper were used to detect KRAS, BRAF, and PIK3CA mutations in 62 paraffinized samples of A-ACs. Of 62 A-ACs, 30.6% had KRAS mutations, but no BRAF mutations and low frequency (1.6%) of PIK3CA mutation were detected. KRAS mutation was correlated with poor tumor differentiation and was a predictor of shorter recurrence-free survival period in overall A-ACs, whereas the prognosis according to the histologic subtypes was not affected by KRAS mutation. Lymph node metastasis was an independent prognostic factor of poor overall survival. Intestinal- and pancreatobiliary-type A-ACs had similar prognosis. Intestinal- and pancreatobiliary-type A-ACs had different prognostic factors; tumor differentiation and lymph node metastasis strongly predicted overall survival and recurrence-free survival in pancreatobiliary-type tumors, respectively, whereas no independent prognostic factors were demonstrated for intestinal-type tumors. Low incidence of KRAS mutations and their strong prognostic value in A-ACs may suggest the potential of survival benefit depending on the epidermal growth factor receptor-targeted therapy. Much lower frequencies of BRAF and PIK3CA mutations may suggest that they do not play a major role in the tumorigenesis of A-ACs. Different therapeutic protocols should be considered for treating pancreatobiliary- and intestinal-type A-ACs.']	('Kwon', 'Mi Jung')	Human pathology	Hum. Pathol.	['eng']

Morphologically, MLs associated with BRAFi therapy (BRAFi-MLs) may demonstrate alarming features of melanoma with an epithelioid cell phenotype with notable cytologic atypia. We sought to characterize the clinicopathological and molecular features of BRAFi-MLs. A retrospective review over a 4-year period revealed 20 patients in which 44 MLs (including 11 control nevi) were characterized by histopathology, review of clinical medical records, and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies (with anti-BRAF V600E, anti-BAP1, anti-cyclin D1, and anti-p16); the percentage of IHC+ cells was scored. Of the 20 patients, 3 (15%) whose BRAFi-MLs were biopsied had a second primary cutaneous melanoma. Of the 44 BRAFi-MLs tested, 37 (100%) of 37 MLs available for BRAF V600E testing lacked expression in contrast to 1 (9%) of 11 control nevi (lesions not associated with targeted therapy). A significantly higher level of cyclin D1 expression (>50% IHC+ cells) was more commonly seen in BRAFi-MLs (44%) than in control nevi (9%). No difference in p16 expression in melanocytes was seen between the 2 groups. BRAF mutation status distinctly differs between BRAFi-MLs from melanomas and nevi biopsied in patients who do not receive BRAFi therapy. Morphologically, BRAFi-MLs demonstrate a greater degree of atypia than do control nevi. Furthermore, BRAFi-MLs with coexisting cutaneous keratinocyte toxicity developed during fewer days of targeted therapy. Paradoxical activation of the MAPK pathway in BRAF(WT) melanocytes may account for ~15% to 21% of patients developing a second new primary melanoma within a year of starting BRAFi therapy; thus, close clinical surveillance is warranted.']	('Mudaliar', 'Kumaran')	Human pathology	Hum.

We aimed to characterize the spectrum of mandibular osteosarcoma using immunohistochemistry and molecular techniques (quantitative polymerase chain reaction and sequencing) and compare them with benign fibro-osseous lesions. Forty-nine paraffin-embedded mandible osteosarcoma tissue samples were collected retrospectively and compared with 10 fibrous dysplasia and 15 ossifying fibroma cases. These were analyzed for molecular markers thought to differ between the different diseases and subtypes: MDM2 (murine double-minute type 2) overexpression, GNAS (guanine nucleotide-binding protein/? subunit) mutations, and amplification of MDM2 and/or RASAL1 (RAS protein activator like 1). Five fibroblastic high-grade osteosarcoma subtypes showed MDM2 amplification, including 2 with a microscopic appearance of high-grade osteosarcoma with part low-grade osteosarcoma (differentiated/dedifferentiated osteosarcoma) and MDM2 overexpression. The other 3 contained a coamplification of MDM2 and RASAL1, a signature also described for juvenile ossifying fibroma, with no overexpression of MDM2. These were of the giant cell-rich high-grade osteosarcoma, with areas mimicking juvenile ossifying fibroma (ossifying fibroma-like osteosarcoma). Our results show that some diagnosed high-grade osteosarcomas are differentiated/dedifferentiated osteosarcomas and harbor an overexpression and amplification of MDM2. In addition, juvenile ossifying fibromas can potentially evolve into giant cell-rich high-grade osteosarcomas and are characterized by a RASAL1 amplification (osteosarcoma with juvenile ossifying fibroma-like genotype). Thus, the presence of a RASAL1 amplification in ossifying fibroma may indicate a requirement for closer follow-up and more aggressive management.']	('Guérin', 'Maxime')	Human pathology	Hum. Pathol.

We analyzed the presence of high-risk HPV using in situ hybridization, protein expressions of p16 and EGFR using immunohistochemistry, and the EGFR gene copy number gain using chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) in 105 cases of OPSCC. The biopsy specimens before chemoradiotherapy were used for these analyses.

EGFR gene copy number gain (high polysomy or amplification) was detected in 12.4% of the OPSCCs and was correlated with EGFR protein overexpression (P = .0667) and worse overall survival (P < .0001). HPV infection and EGFR gene copy number gain (EGFR CISH positive) were mutually exclusive.

Immunohistochemical analysis showed that SMO, SUFU, GLI1, GLI3, and BMP4 expression gradually increased depending on to the histologic tissue type. The protein expression of SMO, SUFU, and GLI1 was increased in unusual leiomyoma and leiomyosarcoma samples compared to normal myometrium. The inhibitor HHIP1 showed higher expression in myometrium, whereas only negative or basal expression of SMO, SUFU, GLI1, and GLI3 was detected in these samples. Strong expression of SHH was associated with poorer overall survival. Our data suggest that the expression of SHH proteins can be useful for evaluating the potential risk of malignancy for USMTs. Moreover, GLI1 and SMO may serve as future therapeutic targets for women with USMTs.']	('Garcia', 'Natalia')	Human pathology	Hum. Pathol.	['eng']
26997436	2016	11	Bronchial involvement in advanced stage lymphangioleiomyomatosis: histopathologic and molecular analyses.	['Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a rare progressive disease that almost exclusively affects women, is characterized by pulmonary cysts and neoplastic proliferation of smooth muscle-like cells (LAM cells). Airflow obstruction is a physiologic consequence that is commonly observed in LAM and has been attributed to narrowing of peripheral airways. However, histopathologic examinations of the entire airway have been precluded by the limited availability of such specimens. Here, we used explanted lung tissues from 30 LAM patients for a thorough histologic analysis with a special emphasis on the bronchi. We found bronchial involvement by LAM cells and lymphatics in all patients examined. Furthermore, a moderate to severe degree of chronic inflammation (73%), goblet cell hyperplasia (97%), squamous cell metaplasia (83%) of the epithelium, and thickening of basal lamina (93%) were identified in the bronchi. Because LAM cells are transformed by the functional loss of the TSC genes leading to a hyperactivated mammalian target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway, we confirmed the expression of phospho-p70S6K, phospho-S6, phospho-4E-BP1, and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-D in LAM cells from all of the patients examined. In contrast, no protein expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1?, a downstream molecule indicative of mTORC1 activation and leading to VEGF production, was detected in any patient. Our study indicates that late-stage LAM patients commonly have bronchi involved by the proliferation of both LAM cells and lymphatics and that chronic inflammation complicated their disease. Furthermore, the up-regulation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1?, a common event in mTORC1-driven tumor cells, does not occur in LAM cells and plays no role in VEGF-D expression in LAM cells.']	('Hayashi', 'Takuo')	Human pathology	Hum.

26997435	2016	11	Immunohistochemical molecular analysis indicates hepatocellular carcinoma subgroups that reflect tumor aggressiveness.	['Histopathologic parameters and molecular markers are widely accepted as useful predictors of tumor aggressiveness in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, few studies have analyzed immunohistochemical profiles comprehensively in one series, a fact that has resulted in fragmentation of information that could be applied in clinical practice. We conducted immunohistochemical expression analysis of biliary/stem cell markers (cytokeratin 19, sal-like protein 4, epithelial cell adhesion molecule, and CD133), Wnt/?-catenin signaling-related molecules (?-catenin and glutamine synthetase), p53, and cell proliferation markers (Ki-67 and mitosis) in 162 HCCs surgically resected from 142 patients and analyzed the results with respect to clinicopathological features. Immunohistochemical analysis broadly identified 3 groups: the biliary/stem cell marker-positive group, the Wnt/?-catenin signaling-related marker-positive group, and the biliary/stem cell marker-negative and Wnt/?-catenin signaling-related marker-negative group. p53 was frequently positive in the biliary/stem cell marker-positive group, but it was rarely positive in the Wnt/?-catenin signaling-related marker-positive group. The biliary/stem cell marker-positive group exhibited poor tumor differentiation, increased frequency of portal vein invasion and/or intrahepatic metastasis, and highly proliferative activity. In contrast, the biliary/stem cell marker-negative and Wnt/?-catenin signaling-related marker-negative group exhibited better tumor differentiation, a decreased frequency of portal vein invasion and/or intrahepatic metastasis, and less proliferative activity. The Wnt/?-catenin signaling-related marker-positive group showed neither tendency. The biliary/stem cell marker-positive group had the shortest time to recurrence among the 3 groups. Immunohistochemical profiling of HCC reflects tumor aggressiveness and suggests the potential efficacy of immunohistochemistry-based subclassification of HCC.']	('Tsujikawa', 'Hanako')	Human pathology	Hum.

['The glycosyltransferases chondroitin sulfate synthase 1 (CHSY1) and exostoses-like 3 (EXTL3) specifically function in biosynthesis of the glycans chondroitin sulfate and heparan sulfate, respectively. Although these glycans play important roles in pathogenesis of various tumors, their significance in soft tissue sarcoma remains unknown. Here, we asked whether CHSY1 or EXTL3 expression correlates with malignant potential of soft tissue sarcomas with myxoid substance. To do so, we examined 40 samples representing specific types, including 12 cases of myxoid liposarcoma, 14 of myxofibrosarcoma, 12 of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and 2 of low-grade fibromyxoid sarcoma. We performed immunohistochemistry with anti-CHSY1 and anti-EXTL3 antibodies and compared enzyme expression levels with tumor histologic grade as assessed by the Fédération Nationale des Centres de Lutte Contre le Cancer classification and with patient 5-year survival rate. CHSY1 and EXTL3 were expressed in 72.5% and 32.5% of all tumors, respectively. Notably, CHSY1 was strongly expressed in myxofibrosarcoma and malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor compared with other tumors and significantly associated with higher- rather than lower-grade tumors (P < .01). High expression of CHSY1 was also significantly associated with poorer patient outcomes (P = .031) and higher stages assessed by American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system (P = .004). By contrast, EXTL3 expression was not correlated with histologic grade or patient prognosis. We conclude that CHSY1 expression is closely associated with malignant potential of soft tissue sarcomas with myxoid substance.']	('Momose', 'Takashige')	Human pathology	Hum. Pathol.	['eng']

Three patients who presented with gastric ulceration 4 to 13 months after (90)Y MRE were examined by esophagogastroduodenoscopy and biopsies. Pathological examinations showed multiple (90)Y microspheres scattered within the lamina propria and submucosa. Most of the microspheres were distributed in a linear fashion, consistent with an intravascular location; however, the vascular lumen and endothelial cells were not present. The microspheres were surrounded by fibrotic tissue infiltrated by chronic inflammatory cells and rare neutrophils. Epithelial granulation without pititis and miniaturized glands with intervening fibrosis were noted, compatible with chronic ischemic changes.

['Endoplasmic reticulum stress and chaperone dysfunction have recently been associated with poor prognoses in various cancers. The newly discovered chaperone protein L-isoaspartyl (D-aspartyl) O-methyltransferase (PIMT) regulates the viability of cancer cells in various cancers, although no clinical information regarding the relationship between lung cancer and PIMT expression has been reported. In this study, we aimed to elucidate the relationship between PIMT expression and the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma. Paraffin-embedded lung tissues obtained from 208 patients with surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma were subjected to immunohistochemical analyses using primary antibodies against PIMT. Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, and the Cox proportional hazards model were used to analyze the association between PIMT expression and patient survival. Strong PIMT expression was detected in 106 (50.9%) patients, being particularly observed in patients with advanced stages of lung adenocarcinoma. Strong PIMT expression was associated with that of 78-kDa glucose-regulated protein, a marker of endoplasmic reticulum stress. Patients with strong PIMT expression had a shorter survival time (Kaplan-Meier analysis, P<.001). Multivariate Cox hazard regression analysis demonstrated that strong PIMT expression was an independent predictor of poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma, including those with stage I disease (hazard ratios, 6.45 and 6.81, respectively; 95% confidence intervals, 2.46-16.9 and 1.79-25.8, respectively; P<.001 and P=.005, respectively). Collectively, strong PIMT expression was a predictive marker of poor prognosis for surgically resected lung adenocarcinoma, and this finding might help clinicians determine the need for postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with stage I lung adenocarcinoma.']	('Saito', 'Heisuke')	Human pathology	Hum.

26989660	2016	12	Recent Advances in the Imaging Diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Value of Gadoxetic Acid-Enhanced MRI.	['Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using gadolinium ethoxybenzyl diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid (Gd-EOB-DPTA), or gadoxetic acid for short, is a hepatocyte-specific contrast agent which is now increasingly used for the detection and characterization of focal hepatic lesions, particularly in patients at high-risk of developing hepatocellular carcinomas (HCC). In fact, several recent guidelines now recognize gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI (Gd-EOB-MRI) as the primary diagnostic imaging modality for the noninvasive diagnosis of HCC, although it must be noted that several major guidelines still include only extracellular contrast media-enhanced computed tomography and MRI. The primary merits of Gd-EOB-MRI lie in the fact that it can provide not only dynamic imaging, but also hepatobiliary phase (HBP) imaging which can lead to high lesion-to-liver contrast and give additional information regarding hepatocyte uptake via organic anion transporting polypeptides. This, in turn, allows higher sensitivity in detecting small HCCs and helps provide additional information regarding the multistep process of hepatocarcinogenesis. Indeed, many recent studies have investigated the diagnostic value of Gd-EOB-MRI for early HCCs as well as its role as a potential imaging biomarker in predicting outcome. We herein review the recent advances in the imaging diagnosis of HCCs focusing on the applications of Gd-EOB-MRI and the challenging issues that remain.']	('Joo', 'Ijin')	Liver cancer	Liver Cancer	['eng']

['In patients with locoregional recurrences of breast cancer not suitable for resection, subsequent local control is difficult to maintain in previously irradiated areas when reirradiation alone or reirradiation with chemotherapy is used. Due to the limited number of treatment options there is a high risk of subsequent failure and uncontrollable local disease. In this group of patients, local hyperthermia combined with radiotherapy increases the clinical response and local control, adding limited acute and late toxicity, as has been shown in randomized trials. Hyperthermia is an artificial elevation of tissue temperature (range 40-44°C for 30-60 min). If hyperthermia is applied shortly before or after radiation, the effect of radiation is enhanced by influencing intratumoral hypoxia and by inhibiting sublethal damage repair in the tumor. Moreover, hyperthermia combined with radiation reduces the total dose of radiation needed compared to radiation alone, of which a higher dose is needed to obtain the same effect. Few data are available on the combination of radiotherapy and hyperthermia with chemotherapy, although the results of trimodality treatment consisting of reirradiation and hyperthermia together with liposomal doxorubicin are promising.

Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer and the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths among women in Asia, accounting for 39% of all breast cancers diagnosed worldwide. The incidence of breast cancer in Asia varies widely across the continent and is still lower than in Western countries, but the proportional contribution of Asia to the global breast cancer rates is increasing rapidly in parallel to the socioeconomic development. However, the mortality-to-incidence ratios are much higher for Asia than for Western countries. Most Asian countries are low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where breast cancer presents at a younger age and a later stage, and where patients are more likely to die from the disease than those in Western countries.

26985457	2015	09	Effect of MRP2 and MRP3 Polymorphisms on Anastrozole Glucuronidation and MRP2 and MRP3 Gene Expression in Normal Liver Samples.	['Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor (AI) used as adjuvant therapy for breast cancer. Anastrozole is subject to direct glucuronidation catalyzed by UDP-glucuronosyltransferase1A4 (UGT1A4). Interindividual variability in anastrozole glucuronidation may be affected by UGT1A4 SNPs. Interplay between drug metabolizing genes such as UGT1A4 and transporter genes may also be affected by genetic variability. Thus, we hypothesize that genetic variability in MRPs could influence anastrozole glucuronidation. The correlation between UGT1A4 and MRP2 or MRP3 transporter gene expressions and the correlation between MRP2 or MRP3 mRNA and anastrozole glucuronidation were analyzed in normal human liver samples. MRP2 and MRP3 mRNA levels were significantly correlated with UGT1A4 mRNA, with anastrozole glucuronidation and with each other (p<0.05). The data also demonstrated that MRP2 SNPs are positively correlated with MRP2 mRNA expression, while there was no association between MRP3 SNPs from this study and MRP3 expression. Significant correlations (p<0.05) between certain MRP2 SNPs (3972C>T, 2366C>T and -24C>T) and anastrozole glucuronidation were observed. There were no observed correlations between MRP3 SNPs and anastrozole glucuronidation. MRP2 polymorphisms have been identified as playing a role in the disposition of other drugs, and the data presented here indicate for the first time that MRP2 SNPs could influence anastrozole metabolism and contribute to interindividual variation in treatment responses.']	('Edavana', 'Vineetha Koroth')	International journal of cancer research and molecular mechanisms	Int J Cancer Res Mol Mech	['eng']
26985398	2015	05	Spatial separation of the processing and MHC class I loading compartments for cross-presentation of the tumor-associated antigen HER2/neu by human dendritic cells.	['Cross-presentation is the process by which professional antigen presenting cells (APCs) (B cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages) present endocytosed antigens (Ags) via MHC-I to CD8+ T cells. This process is crucial for induction of adaptive immune responses against tumors and infected cells. The pathways and cellular compartments involved in cross-presentation are unresolved and controversial. Among the cells with cross-presenting capacity, DCs are the most efficient, which was proposed to depend on prevention of endosomal acidification to block degradation of the epitopes. Contrary to this view, we show in this report that some cargoes induce strong endosomal acidification following uptake by human DCs, while others not. Moreover, processing of the tumor-associated antigen HER2/neu delivered in nanoparticles (NP) for cross-presentation of the epitope HER2/neu369-377 on HLA-A2 depended on endosomal acidification and cathepsin activity as well as proteasomes, and newly synthesized HLA class I. However, the HLA-A*0201/HER2/neu369-377 complexes were not found in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) nor in endolysosomes but in hitherto not described vesicles. The data thus indicate spatial separation of antigen processing and loading of MHC-I for cross-presentation: antigen processing occurs in the uptake compartment and the cytosol whereas MHC-I loading with peptide takes place in a distinct subcellular compartment. The findings further elucidate the cellular pathways involved in the cross-presentation of a full-length, clinically relevant tumor-associated antigen by human DCs, and the impact of the vaccine formulation on antigen processing and CD8+ T cell induction.']	('Baleeiro', 'Renato B')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

['C646 inhibits the lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) p300 and CBP and represents the most potent and selective small molecule KAT inhibitor identified to date. To gain insights into the cellular activity of this epigenetic probe, we applied chemoproteomics to identify covalent targets of the C646 chemotype. Modeling and synthetic derivatization was used to develop a clickable analogue (C646-yne) that inhibits p300 similarly to the parent compound and enables enrichment of bound proteins. LC-MS/MS identified the major covalent targets of C646-yne as highly abundant cysteine-containing proteins, and follow-up studies found that C646 can inhibit tubulin polymerization in vitro. Finally, we provide evidence that thiol reactivity of C646 may limit its ability to antagonize acetylation in cells. These findings should enable a more precise interpretation of studies utilizing C646 as a chemical probe of KAT activity and suggest that an underappreciated liability of electrophile-containing inhibitors is a reduction in their cellular potency due to consumption by abundant protein and metabolite thiol sinks.']	('Shrimp', 'Jonathan H')	ACS medicinal chemistry letters	ACS Med Chem Lett	['eng']

HCV replication in cell culture is generally highly sensitive to interferons (IFNs) and differences in the IFN-mediated inhibition of virus replication may reflect alterations in the IFN-induced antiviral response inherent to different host cells. For example, HCV replication is highly sensitive to IFN-? treatment in Huh-7, but not in HuH6 cells. In this study, we used microarray-based gene expression profiling to compare the response of Huh-7 and HuH6 cells to stimulation with IFN-? and IFN-?. Furthermore, we determined whether the resistance of HCV replication in HuH6 cells can be linked to differences in the expression profile of IFN-regulated genes.

Semi-quantitative immunohistochemistry of primary breast tumors using antibodies to RelA, the pleiotropic NF-kB factor, and Ki67 revealed a negative correlation between RelA levels and Ki67-index among ER\xa0+/HER2\xa0- tumors [1]. Similarly, expression of AURKA, a marker for proliferation, negatively correlates with expression of NFKBIA, a surrogate for RelA expression and activity, in ER\xa0+/HER2\xa0- tumors analyzed by The Cancer Genome Atlas [2], [3], [4]. Furthermore, conditional expression of RelA using a Tetracycline-inducible system in Human Mammary Epithelial Cells (HRA cells) caused proliferation arrest while withdrawal of Doxycycline (Dox) and suppression of RelA expression in arrested cells restored cell cycle progression [1]. To identify genes responsible for the negative relationship between RelA levels and proliferation, we performed genome-wide gene expression analysis of HRA cells under the following conditions: RelA un-induced, No Dox (ND); Dox induced for 24\xa0h; Dox induced for 72\xa0h; Dox induced for 24\xa0h then Dox withdrawn for 48\xa0h.

"['Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is the most common adult leukemia. While therapeutic antibodies show clinical activity in CLL patients, resistance inevitably develops resulting in treatment failure. Identifying mechanisms of antibody resistance and methods to reduce resistance would be valuable in managing CLL. Monocyte derived cells (MDCs), also known as nurse like cells (NLCs) in CLL [1], [2], are known to be crucial components of the CLL microenvironment network and following ""maturation"" in in vitro culture systems are able to provide support for the survival of the malignant B cells from CLL patients. In addition to their protective role, MDCs are key effector cells in mediating responses to therapeutic antibody therapies [3]. We have determined that macrophages from patients with early stable CLL are able to elicit superior cytotoxic response to therapeutic antibodies than macrophages derived from patients with progressive CLL. We have exploited this unique finding to gain insight into antibody resistance. Thus, we have profiled monocytes on day 0 and MDCs on day 7 from antibody sensitive and antibody resistant CLL patients (GEO accession number GEO: GSE71409). We show that there are no significant differences in transcriptomes from the monocytes or MDCs derived from sensitive or resistant patient samples.

['Natural products from wild and medicinal plants, either in the form of crude extracts or pure compounds provide unlimited opportunities for new drug leads owing to the unmatched availability of chemical diversity. In the present study, the cytotoxic potential of crude ethanolic extract of Ochradenus arabicus was analyzed by MTT cell viability assay in MCF-7 adenocarcinoma breast cancer cells. We further investigated its effect against oxidative stress induced by anticancer drug doxorubicin. In addition, Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (UPLC-MS) based chromatographic profiling of crude extract of O. arabicus was performed. The MTT assay data showed that the extract is moderately toxic to the MCF-7 cells. However, its treatment alone does not induce oxidative stress while doxorubicin increases the level of oxidative stress in MCF-7 cells. Whereas, simultaneous treatment of plant extract and doxorubicin significantly (p\xa0<\xa00.05) decreased the level of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and lipid peroxidation while an increase in the reduced glutathione and superoxide dismutase activity was observed in time and dose dependent manner. Hence, our finding confirmed cytotoxic and antioxidant potential of crude extract of O. arabicus in MCF-7 cells. However, further investigations on O. arabicus as a potential chemotherapeutic agent are needed. The analysis of bioactive compounds present in the plant extracts involving the applications of common phytochemical screening assays such as chromatographic techniques is discussed.']	('Ali', 'M Ajmal')	Saudi journal of biological sciences	Saudi J Biol Sci	['eng']

26979638	2016	12	Making cancer visible--Dyes in surgical oncology.	['Dyes share an intricate relationship with oncology. Dyes can cause cancer as chemical carcinogens, but can also be harnessed against cancer when used as diagnostic and therapeutic agents. Histopathology, imaging, and newer molecular diagnostics all rely on dyes, and their use in sentinel lymph node biopsies and intra-operative imaging has helped drive a paradigm shift in cancer surgery towards minimally-invasive and organ sparing approaches with enhanced resection accuracy. As therapeutic agents, the cytotoxicity of specific dyes can be employed in direct chemo-ablation or in photodynamic therapy. The same agent can have dual functionalities in cancer detection and treatment, in a novel field known as theranostics. This is facilitated by newer generation dyes conjugated with tumour-targeting probes such as antibodies, and these bio-conjugate agents can also incorporate nanotechnology or radio-isotopes. Further advances will be closely aligned with our increasing understanding of molecular oncology, and will form a new generation of cancer detection and treatment agents that promote precision medicine for cancer. Dyes and their roles have evolved and been reinvented, but they remain relevant as ever.

['With the properties of efficacy, safety, tolerability, practicability and low cost, foods containing bioactive phytochemicals are gaining significant attention as elements of chemoprevention strategies against cancer. Sulforaphane [1-isothiocyanato-4-(methylsulfinyl)butane], a naturally occurring isothiocyanate produced by cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, is found to be a highly promising chemoprevention agent against not only a variety of cancers such as breast, prostate, colon, skin, lung, stomach or bladder, but also cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative diseases, and diabetes. For reasons of experimental exigency, preclinical studies have focused principally on sulforaphane itself, while clinical studies have relied on broccoli sprout preparations rich in either sulforaphane or its biogenic precursor, glucoraphanin. Substantive subsequent evaluation of sulforaphane pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics has been undertaken using either pure compound or food matrices. Sulforaphane affects multiple targets in cells. One key molecular mechanism of action for sulforaphane entails activation of the Nrf2-Keap1 signaling pathway although other actions contribute to the broad spectrum of efficacy in different animal models. This review summarizes the current status of pre-clinical chemoprevention studies with sulforaphane and highlights the progress and challenges for the application of foods rich in sulforaphane and/or glucoraphanin in the arena of clinical chemoprevention.']	('Yang', 'Li')	Seminars in oncology	Semin.

Among the strategies to overcome such obstacles to preventive therapies, two novel and potentially safer modes of administering agents are discussed in this paper. The first strategy is to lower the dose of drugs that are in common use in the adjuvant setting based on the notion that prevention of cancer cells from developing should require a lower dose than eradicating established tumor cells. A second approach is to adopt an intermittent administration similar to what is used in the chemotherapy setting in an attempt to minimize risks while retaining benefits.

26970129	2016	10	Novel routes for administering chemoprevention: local transdermal therapy to the breasts.	['Breast cancer prevention with pharmacologic agents requires that the breast be exposed to an effective drug; systemic exposure is unnecessary, and its harms lead many eligible women to decline preventive therapy. Local transdermal therapy (LTT) to the breast involves the application of active drugs to the breast skin, resulting in high concentrations in the breast but low systemic exposure. It is non-invasive, self-delivered, and not dependent on hepatic metabolism. Existing data on LTT include investigations demonstrating relief of mastalgia with topical 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT, an active tamoxifen metabolite). Two presurgical window trials in women with invasive breast cancer, and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) demonstrate that LTT decreases proliferation of invasive and non-invasive cancer cells to a similar degree as oral tamoxifen, with low systemic levels, and no effect on coagulation proteins. These data are promising regarding the use of LTT for the primary prevention of breast cancer, and for therapy of DCIS, since systemic exposure is not required for either of these purposes. They also suggest that an LTT approach could be developed for any small, lipophilic molecule with good dermal permeation, thus greatly expanding the menu of drugs that could be tested for breast cancer prevention.']	('Lee', 'Oukseub')	Seminars in oncology	Semin.

26970128	2016	09	The microbiome and its potential as a cancer preventive intervention.	['It is becoming increasingly clear that microbiota inhabiting our bodies influence cancer predisposition and etiology. In addition to pathogens with oncogenic properties, commensal and symbiotic microbiota have tumor-suppressive properties. Diet and other environmental factors can modulate the abundance of certain members of microbial communities within the gastrointestinal tract and at other anatomical sites. Furthermore, some dietary factors are metabolized by commensal/symbiotic gut microbiota into bioactive food components believed to prevent cancer. For example, dietary fiber undergoes bacterial fermentation in the colon to yield butyrate, which is a short-chain fatty acid and histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor that suppresses the viability and growth of colorectal cancer cell lines. A recent study using gnotobiotic mouse models demonstrates that fiber can protect against colorectal tumorigenesis in a microbiota- and butyrate-dependent manner that involves the Warburg effect. This and other examples suggest that some of the inter-individual variation observed in epidemiology and intervention studies that have investigated associations between diet and cancer risk might be explained by differences in microbiota among the participants. Data from basic research studies also support the idea that probiotics and prebiotics could be plausible chemoprevention strategies that may be utilized to a greater extent in the future.']	('Bultman', 'Scott J')	Seminars in oncology	Semin.

26970127	2016	09	Microbiome and potential targets for chemoprevention of esophageal adenocarcinoma.	"[""Esophageal cancer is one of the deadliest cancers, with a dismal prognosis. It is increasingly recognized that esophageal cancer is a heterogeneous disease. It can be subdivided into two distinct groups: squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma, based on histological appearance. In the Western world, the incidence of squamous cell carcinoma was considerably higher than esophageal adenocarcinoma (EA) until the 1990s when, due to a dramatic increase, the incidence of EA surpassed that of squamous cell carcinoma. EA typically follows a well-established stepwise evolution from chronic inflammation due to reflux esophagitis (RE) that progresses to metaplasia (Barrett's esophagus [BE]) to dysplasia, which often culminates in EA. The pathophysiology of EA is complex and involves diverse factors, including gastroesophageal reflux, gastric acid secretion, dysfunction of the antireflux barrier, gastric emptying disturbances, and abnormalities in esophageal defense mechanisms. The current understanding of the etiology of EA is mainly derived from epidemiological studies of risk factors such as cigarette smoking, obesity, gastroesophageal reflux disorders (GERD), and low fruit and vegetable consumption. Numerous studies have been done, but the factors that drive the dynamic increase in the incidence of EA remain elusive. The advent of widespread antibiotic use occurred in the 1950s, preceding the surge of EA. Based on this temporal sequence, it has been hypothesized that antibiotics alter the microbiome to which the esophagus is exposed in patients who have GERD and that chronic exposure to this abnormal microbiome (ie, changes in species diversity or abundance) accounts for the increase in EA. If changes in the proposed factors alter the stepwise progression (RE-BE-dysplasia-EA), they may represent potential targets for chemoprevention. New discoveries will help improve our understanding of the biology and pathogenesis of these cancers, and aid in finding novel therapeutic targets.""]"	('Neto', 'Antonio Galvao')	Seminars in oncology	Semin.

"[""The incidence of esophageal adenocarcinoma (EAC), a debilitating and highly lethal malignancy, has risen dramatically over the past 40 years in the United States and other Western countries. To reverse this trend, EAC prevention and early detection efforts by clinicians, academic researchers and endoscope manufacturers have targeted Barrett's esophagus (BE), the widely accepted EAC precursor lesion. Data from surgical, endoscopic and pre-clinical investigations strongly support the malignant potential of BE. For patients with BE, the risk of developing EAC has been estimated at 11- to 125-fold greater than that of the individual at average risk. Nevertheless, screening for BE in symptomatic patients (ie, with symptoms of reflux) and surveillance in patients diagnosed with BE have not had a substantial impact on the incidence, morbidity or mortality of EAC; the overwhelming majority of EAC patients are diagnosed without a pre-operative diagnosis of BE. This article will discuss the current state of the science of esophageal adenocarcinoma prevention, including ideas about carcinogenesis and its underlying genomic and molecular level mechanisms, and suggest strategies for a systems approach to targeted preventive management.""]"	('Richmond', 'Ellen')	Seminars in oncology	Semin.

"['Early in the age of modern medicine the consequences of vitamin A deficiency drew attention to the fundamental link between retinoid-dependent homeostatic regulation and malignant hyperproliferative diseases. The term ""retinoid"" includes a handful of endogenous and a large group of synthetic derivatives of vitamin A. These multifunctional lipid-soluble compounds directly regulate target genes of specific biological functions and critical signaling pathways to orchestrate complex functions from vision to development, metabolism, and inflammation. Many of the retinoid activities on the cellular level have been well characterized and translated to the regulation of processes like differentiation and cell death, which play critical roles in the outcome of malignant transformation of tissues. In fact, retinoid-based differentiation therapy of acute promyelocytic leukemia was one of the first successful examples of molecularly targeted treatment strategies. The selectivity, high receptor binding affinity and the ability of retinoids to directly modulate gene expression programs present a distinct pharmacological opportunity for cancer treatment and prevention. However, to fully exploit their potential, the adverse effects of retinoids must be averted. In this review we provide an overview of the biology of retinoid (activated by nuclear retinoic acid receptors [RARs]) and rexinoid (engaged by nuclear retinoid X receptors [RXRs]) action concluded from a long line of preclinical studies, in relation to normal and transformed states of cells. We will also discuss the past and current uses of retinoids in the treatment of malignancies, the potential of rexinoids in the cancer prevention setting, both as single agents and in combinations.']"	('Uray', 'Iván P')	Seminars in oncology	Semin.

Gradually advancing technology and most recently, the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS), combined with bioinformatics analytic tools, have revolutionized our ability to interrogate cancer cells. The ultimate goal is to apply these high-throughput technologies to the various aspects of clinical cancer care: cancer-risk assessment, diagnosis, as well as target identification for treatment and prevention.

['Juvenile hormone analog (JHA) insecticides are biological and structural mimics of JH, a key insect developmental hormone. Toxic and anti-developmental effects of the JHA insecticides methoprene, fenoxycarb, and pyriproxyfen were investigated on the larval and pupal stages of Spodoptera littoralis and Spodoptera frugiperda. Bioassays showed that fenoxycarb has the highest toxicity and fastest speed of kill in 2nd instar S. littoralis. All three JHAs affected the development of 6th instar (i.e., final instar) and pupal S. frugiperda. JH esterase (JHE) is a critical enzyme that helps to regulate JH levels during insect development. JHE activity in the last instar S. littoralis and S. frugiperda was 11 and 23 nmol min(-1) ml(-1) hemolymph, respectively. Methoprene and pyriproxyfen showed poor inhibition of JHE activity from these insects, whereas fenoxycarb showed stronger inhibition. The inhibitory activity of fenoxycarb, however, was more than 1000-fold lower than that of OTFP, a highly potent inhibitor of JHEs. Surprisingly, topical application of methoprene, fenoxycarb or pyriproxyfen on 6th instars of S. littoralis and S. frugiperda prevented the dramatic reduction in JHE activity that was found in control insects.

The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of Lake Ontario fish consumption and the estimated consumption of PCBs and omega-3 fatty acids on the risk of thyroid cancer in a group of sport fishermen. Anglers from the New York State Angler Cohort Study were followed for cancer incidence from 1991-2008. Twenty-seven cases of incident thyroid cancer and 108 controls were included in the analyses. Total estimated fish consumption, estimated omega-3 fatty acid consumption, and estimated PCB consumption from Lake Ontario fish were examined for an association with the incidence of thyroid cancer, while matching on sex, and controlling for age and smoking status. Results from logistic regression indicate no significant associations between fish consumption, short-term estimated omega-3 fatty acids, or estimated PCB consumption from Great Lakes fish and the development of thyroid cancer, but it was suggested that long-term omega-3 fatty acid from Great Lakes fish may be protective of the development of thyroid cancer. In conclusion, fish consumption, with the possible concomitant PCBs, from the Great Lakes does not appear to increase the risk of thyroid cancer in New York anglers. Further research is needed in order to separate the individual health effects of PCBs from omega-3 fatty acids contained within the fish.']	('Haslam', 'Alyson')	Journal of environmental sciences (China)	J Environ Sci (China)	['eng']

On average, low carbon-containing species (C1-C4), e.g., formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, acetone and butyraldehyde were dominant and contributed 55.01%-94.52% of total carbonyls in the dining areas of all restaurants. Meanwhile, Chinese-Western mixed restaurants (45.48ppb) had high total carbonyl concentrations in kitchens mainly because of its small kitchen and poor ventilation. However, high carbon-containing species (C5-C10) such as hexaldehyde, heptaldehyde and nonanaldehyde (16.62%-77.00% of total carbonyls) contributed comparatively with low carbon-containing compounds (23.01%-83.39% of total carbonyls) in kitchens.

However, many of the modern chemotherapies are associated with cardiovascular toxicities that increase cardiovascular risk in cancer patients, including hypertension, thrombosis, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, and arrhythmias. These limitations restrict treatment options and might negatively affect the management of cancer. The cardiotoxic effects of older chemotherapeutic drugs such as alkylating agents, antimetabolites, and anticancer antibiotics have been known for a while. The newer agents, such as the antiangiogenic drugs that inhibit vascular endothelial growth factor signalling are also associated with cardiovascular pathology, especially hypertension, thromboembolism, myocardial infarction, and proteinuria. Exact mechanisms by which vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitors cause these complications are unclear but impaired endothelial function, vascular and renal damage, oxidative stress, and thrombosis might be important. With increasing use of modern chemotherapies and prolonged survival of cancer patients, the incidence of cardiovascular disease in this patient population will continue to increase. Accordingly, careful assessment and management of cardiovascular risk factors in cancer patients by oncologists and cardiologists working together is essential for optimal care so that prolonged cancer survival is not at the expense of increased cardiovascular events.']	('Cameron', 'Alan C')	The Canadian journal of cardiology	Can J Cardiol	['eng']

['Collagen XVII is a hemidesmosomal anchorage molecule of basal keratinocytes that promotes stable epidermal-dermal adhesion. One unique feature of collagen XVII is that its collagenous ectodomain is constitutively released from the cell surface by a disintegrin and metalloproteinases (ADAMs) through cleavage within its juxtamembranous linker domain. The responsivity of shedding to environmental stimuli and the high stability of the released ectodomain in several tissues suggests functions in cell detachment during epidermal morphogenesis, differentiation, and regeneration, but its physiologic relevance remained elusive. To investigate this, we generated knock-in mice, which express a functional non-sheddable collagen XVII mutant, with a 41 amino acid deletion in the linker domain spanning all ADAM cleavage sites. These mice showed no macroscopic phenotypic changes, were fertile, and had a normal lifespan. Prevention of collagen XVII shedding interfered neither with skin development nor with epidermal adhesion and differentiation. However, it led to faster wound closure due to accelerated re-epithelialization at the wound edges where shedding of wild-type collagen XVII was strongly induced. Taken together, we have successfully generated a functional non-shedding collagen XVII mouse model, which represents a powerful tool to investigate the pathophysiologic relevance of ectodomain shedding during wound regeneration and cancer invasion.']	('Jacków', 'Joanna')	The Journal of investigative dermatology	J.

Currently, there are no medications to treat HPV infection, and therapeutic strategies primarily target HPV-related cancer rather than viral infection. HPV infection has severe effects on patients who display selective susceptibility to the virus in the context of primary immunodeficiencies, such as the warts, hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis syndrome, which is caused by dysfunctions of CXCR4, the receptor for the CXCL12 chemokine. In this study we showed in a transgenic mouse model of HPV-induced epidermal neoplasia the beneficial effects of Cxcl12/Cxcr4 pathway blockade with the selective CXCR4 antagonist AMD3100. Daily treatment with AMD3100 for 28 days potently reduced the abnormal ear epidermal thickening in all mice. This effect was associated with reductions in keratinocyte hyperproliferation and immune cell infiltration, both of which are linked to neoplastic progression. Moreover, we observed the abnormal coordinate expression of Cxcl12 and p16INK4a (a surrogate marker of HPV-induced cancers) in dysplastic epidermal keratinocytes, which was inhibited by AMD3100 treatment. These results provide strong evidence for the therapeutic potential of CXCL12/CXCR4 pathway blockade in HPV-induced pathogenesis.']	('Meuris', 'Floriane')	The Journal of investigative dermatology	J.

['Despite significant advances in melanoma therapy, melanoma remains the deadliest form of skin cancer, with a 5-year survival rate of only 15%. Thus, novel treatments are required to address this disease. Notch and ERBB are evolutionarily conserved signaling cascades required for the maintenance of melanocyte precursors. We show that active Notch1 (Notch1(NIC)) and active (phosphorylated) ERBB3 and ERBB2 correlate significantly and are similarly expressed in both mutated and wild-type BRAF melanomas, suggesting these receptors are co-reactivated in melanoma to promote survival. Whereas blocking either pathway triggers modest effects, combining a ?-secretase inhibitor to block Notch activation and a tyrosine kinase inhibitor to inhibit ERBB3/2 elicits synergistic effects, reducing cell viability by 90% and hampering melanoma tumor growth. Specific inhibition of Notch1 and ERBB3 mimics these results, suggesting these are the critical factors triggering melanoma tumor expansion. Notch and ERBB inhibition blunts AKT and NF?B signaling. Constitutive expression of NF?B partially rescues cell death. Blockade of both Notch and ERBB signaling inhibits the slow cycling JARID1B-positive cell population, which is critical for long-term maintenance of melanoma growth. We propose that blocking these pathways is an effective approach to treatment of melanoma patients regardless of whether they carry mutated or wild-type BRAF.']	('Zhang', 'Keman')	The Journal of investigative dermatology	J.

26967478	2016	11	MIG6 Is MEK Regulated and Affects EGF-Induced Migration in Mutant NRAS Melanoma.	['Activating mutations in neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog (NRAS) are frequent driver events in cutaneous melanoma. NRAS is a guanosine triphosphate-binding protein whose most well-characterized downstream effector is RAF, leading to activation of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MEK)-extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 signaling. Although there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved targeted therapies for melanoma patients with a primary mutation in NRAS, one form of targeted therapy that has been explored is MEK inhibition. In clinical trials, MEK inhibitors have shown disappointing efficacy in mutant NRAS patients, the reasons for which are unclear. To explore the effects of MEK inhibitors in mutant NRAS melanoma, we used a high-throughput reverse-phase protein array platform to identify signaling alterations. Reverse-phase protein array analysis of phospho-proteomic changes in mutant NRAS melanoma in response to trametinib indicated a compensatory increase in v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog signaling and decreased expression of mitogen-inducible gene 6 (MIG6), a negative regulator of epidermal growth factor receptor/v-erb-b2 erythroblastic leukemia viral oncogene homolog receptors. MIG6 expression did not alter the growth or survival properties of mutant NRAS melanoma cells. Rather, we identified a role for MIG6 as a negative regulator of epidermal growth factor-induced signaling and cell migration and invasion. In MEK-inhibited cells, further depletion of MIG6 increased migration and invasion, whereas MIG6 expression decreased these properties. Therefore, a decrease in MIG6 may promote the migration and invasiveness of MEK-inhibited mutant NRAS melanoma, especially in response to epidermal growth factor stimulation.']	('Vu', 'Ha Linh')	The Journal of investigative dermatology	J.

Apoptosis induction was assessed by DNA fragmentation assay, cell cycle analysis and Annexin V-FITC/PI staining. Cell killing was confirmed by cell counting and microscopic examination. The mitochondrial and Ca(2+)-dependent pathways were investigated. Caspase-8 expression and autophagy-related proteins were detected by spectrophotometry and western blot analysis, respectively. Intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) elevation was detected by flow cytometry, while extracellular free radical formation was assessed by electron paramagnetic resonance spin trapping spectrometry. The results showed that Pt-NPs exerted differential effects depending on their internalization. Pt-NPs functioned as potent free radical scavengers when added immediately before sonication while pre-treatment with Pt-NPs suppressed the induction of apoptosis as well as autophagy (AP), and resulted in enhanced cell killing. Dead cells displayed the features of pyknosis. The exact mode of cell death is still unclear. In conclusion, the results indicate that US-induced AP may contribute to cell survival post sonication.

Most of these deaths occur in resource-poor countries, where lack of infrastructure prevents timely reporting and postexposure prophylaxis and the ubiquity of domestic and wild animal hosts makes eradication unlikely. Moreover, although the disease is rarer than other human infections such as influenza, the prognosis following a bite from a rabid animal is poor: There is currently no effective treatment that will save the life of a symptomatic rabies patient.

To uncouple differentiation from continued cellular propagation, HPVs express two oncoproteins, HPV E6 and E7. This review focuses on high-risk ?-HPV E6, which in addition to supporting viral replication has transforming properties.

The ubiquitin-like homology fold (UBL) represents a large family that encompasses both post-translational modifications, like ubiquitin (UBQ) and SUMO, and functional domains on many biologically important proteins like Parkin, UHRF1 (ubiquitin-like with PDB and RING finger domains-1), and Usp7 (ubiquitin-specific protease-7) (Zhang et al., 2015; Rothbart et al., 2013;\xa0Burroughs et al., 2012;\xa0Wauer et al., 2015)\xa0[2], [3], [4], [5]. The UBL domain can participate in several unique protein-protein interactions (PPI) since protein adducts can be attached to and removed from amino groups of lysine side chains and the N-terminus of proteins. Given the biological significance of UBL domains, many have been characterized with high-resolution techniques, and for UBQ and SUMO, many protein complexes have been characterized. We identified all the UBL domains in the PDB and created a relational database called UbSRD (Ubiquitin Structural Relational Database) by using structural analysis tools in the Rosetta (Leaver et al., 2013; O\'Meara et al., 2015; Leaver-fay et al., 2011)\xa0[1], [6], [7], [8].

['Radiation therapy with protons and heavier ions is an attractive form of cancer treatment that could enhance local control and survival of cancers that are currently difficult to cure and lead to less side effects due to sparing of normal tissues. However, particle therapy faces a significant technical challenge because one cannot accurately predict the particle range in the patient using data provided by existing imaging technologies. Proton computed tomography (pCT) is an emerging imaging modality capable of improving the accuracy of range prediction. In this paper, we describe the successive pCT scanners designed and built by our group with the goal to support particle therapy treatment planning and image guidance by reconstructing an accurate 3D map of the stopping power relative to water in patient tissues. The pCT scanners we have built to date consist of silicon telescopes, which track the proton before and after the object to be reconstructed, and an energy or range detector, which measures the residual energy and/or range of the protons used to evaluate the water equivalent path length (WEPL) of each proton in the object. An overview of a decade-long evolution of the conceptual design of pCT scanners and their calibration is given. Results of scanner performance tests are presented, which demonstrate that the latest pCT scanner approaches readiness for clinical applications in hadron therapy.']	('Bashkirov', 'Vladimir A')	Nuclear instruments & methods in physics research.

26955657	2015	06	The use of 18F-2-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) to label antibody fragments for immuno-PET of pancreatic cancer.	['We generated 18F-labeled antibody fragments for PET imaging using a sortase-mediated reaction to install a transcyclooctene (TCO)-functionalized short peptide onto proteins of interest, followed by reaction with a tetrazine-labeled-18F-2-deoxyfluoroglucose (FDG). The method is rapid, robust, and site-specific (radiochemical yields >25%, not decay corrected). The availability of 18F-2-deoxyfluoroglucose avoids the need for more complicated chemistries used to generate carbon-fluorine bonds. We demonstrate the utility of the method by detecting heterotopic pancreatic tumors in mice by PET, using anti-Class II MHC single domain antibodies. We correlate macroscopic PET images with microscopic two-photon visualization of the tumor. Our approach provides easy access to 18F-labeled antibodies and their fragments at a level of molecular specificity that complements conventional18F-FDG imaging.']	('Rashidian', 'Mohammad')	ACS central science	ACS Cent Sci	['eng']

['High-speed coherent Raman scattering imaging is opening a new avenue to unveiling the cellular machinery by visualizing the spatio-temporal dynamics of target molecules or intracellular organelles. By extracting signals from the laser at MHz modulation frequency, current stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy has reached shot noise limited detection sensitivity. The laser-based local oscillator in SRS microscopy not only generates high levels of signal, but also delivers a large shot noise which degrades image quality and spectral fidelity. Here, we demonstrate a denoising algorithm that removes the noise in both spatial and spectral domains by total variation minimization. The signal-to-noise ratio of SRS spectroscopic images was improved by up to 57 times for diluted dimethyl sulfoxide solutions and by 15 times for biological tissues. Weak Raman peaks of target molecules originally buried in the noise were unraveled. Coupling the denoising algorithm with multivariate curve resolution allowed discrimination of fat stores from protein-rich organelles in C. elegans. Together, our method significantly improved detection sensitivity without frame averaging, which can be useful for in vivo spectroscopic imaging.']	('Liao', 'Chien-Sheng')	The journal of physical chemistry.

['Perfluoropentane (PFP) gas filled biodegradable iron-doped silica nanoshells have been demonstrated as long-lived ultrasound contrast agents. Nanoshells are synthesized by a sol-gel process with tetramethyl orthosilicate (TMOS) and iron ethoxide. Substituting a fraction of the TMOS with R-substituted trialkoxysilanes produces ultrathin nanoshells with varying shell thicknesses and morphologies composed of fused nanoflakes. The ultrathin nanoshells had continuous ultrasound Doppler imaging lifetimes exceeding 3 hours, were twice as bright using contrast specific imaging, and had decreased pressure thresholds compared to control nanoshells synthesized with just TMOS. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed that the R-group substituted trialkoxysilanes could reduce the mechanically critical nanoshell layer to 1.4 nm. These ultrathin nanoshells have the mechanical behavior of weakly linked nanoflakes but the chemical stability of silica. The synthesis can be adapted for general fabrication of three-dimensional nanostructures composed of nanoflakes, which have thicknesses from 1.4-3.8 nm and diameters from 2-23 nm.']	('Liberman', 'A')	Advanced functional materials	Adv Funct Mater	['eng']

In the present review, we explored the contradictory data related to the prognostic value of KRAS mutations, the reported frequent discordance of KRAS mutations, and the reported nonequivalence of some of these mutations. We also considered the issues related to incorporating additional mutations into the already accredited and approved assays and the challenges created by changing an assay's analytical and clinical limits of detection. We also discuss the lack of biologic data supporting the pathogenicity of newly described clinically actionable mutations and explore the uncertainty regarding the clinical significance of low-frequency mutations, highlighting the importance of correcting allele frequencies for tumor purity.

26949565	2016	11	Towards Better Precision Medicine: PacBio Single-Molecule Long Reads Resolve the Interpretation of HIV Drug Resistant Mutation Profiles at Explicit Quasispecies (Haplotype) Level.	"[""Development of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations (HDRMs) is one of the major reasons for the clinical failure of antiretroviral therapy. Treatment success rates can be improved by applying personalized anti-HIV regimens based on a patient's HDRM profile. However, the sensitivity and specificity of the HDRM profile is limited by the methods used for detection. Sanger-based sequencing technology has traditionally been used for determining HDRM profiles at the single nucleotide variant (SNV) level, but with a sensitivity of only ? 20% in the HIV population of a patient. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) technologies offer greater detection sensitivity (~ 1%) and larger scope (hundreds of samples per run). However, NGS technologies produce reads that are too short to enable the detection of the physical linkages of individual SNVs across the haplotype of each HIV strain present. In this article, we demonstrate that the single-molecule long reads generated using the Third Generation Sequencer (TGS), PacBio RS II, along with the appropriate bioinformatics analysis method, can resolve the HDRM profile at a more advanced quasispecies level. The case studies on patients' HIV samples showed that the quasispecies view produced using the PacBio method offered greater detection sensitivity and was more comprehensive for understanding HDRM situations, which is complement to both Sanger and NGS technologies.

26949369	2015	06	Cytocompatibility of direct water synthesized cadmium selenide quantum dots in colo-205 cells.	['Cadmium selenide quantum dots (CdSe QDs), inorganic semiconducting nanocrystals, are alluring increased attraction due to their highly refined chemistry, availability, and super tunable optical properties suitable for many applications in different research areas, such as photovoltaics, light-emitting devices, environmental sciences, and nanomedicine. Specifically, they are being widely used in bio-imaging in contrast to organic dyes due to their high brightness and improved photo-stability, and their ability to tune their absorption and emission spectra upon changing the crystal size. The production of CdSe QDs is mostly assisted by trioctylphosphine oxide compound, which acts as solvent or solubilizing agent and renders the QDs soluble in organic compounds (such as toluene, chloroform, and hexane) that are highly toxic. To circumvent the toxicity-related factor in CdSe QDs, we report the synthesis of CdSe QDs capped with thioglycolic acid (TGA) in an aqueous medium, and their biocompatibility in colo-205 cancer cells. In this study, the [Cd2+]/[TGA] ratio was adjusted to 11:1 and the Se concentration (10 and 15 mM) was monitored in order to evaluate its influence on the optical properties and cytocompatibility. QDs resulted to be quite stable in water (after purification) and RPMI cell medium and no precipitation was observed for long contact times, making them appealing for in vitro experiments. The spectroscopy analysis, advanced electron microscopy, and X-ray diffractometry studies indicate that the final products were successfully formed exhibiting an improved optical response. Colo-205 cells being exposed to different concentrations of TGA-capped CdSe QDs for 12, 24, and 48 h with doses ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 mM show high tolerance reaching cell viabilities as high as 93 %. No evidence of cellular apoptotic pathways was observed as pointed out by our Annexin V assays at higher concentrations. Moreover, confocal microscopy analysis conducted to evaluate the intracellular uptake of TGA-CdSe QDs reveal that the TGA-CdSe QDs were uniformly distributed within the cytosolic side of cell membranes. Our results also suggest that under controlled conditions, direct water-soluble TGA-CdSe QDs can be potentially employed for bio-imaging colo-205 cancer cells with minimal adverse effects.']	('Rodriguez-Torres', 'Marcos R')	Journal of nanoparticle research : an interdisciplinary forum for nanoscale science and technology	J Nanopart Res	['eng']

Therefore, establishing a preoperative diagnosis of IgG4-related cholecystitis was very difficult, and a differential diagnosis of gallbladder cancer infiltrating the liver was suggested. Postoperative histopathological examination established a diagnosis of IgG4-related cholecystitis definitively. A preoperative diagnosis of IgG4-related cholecystitis, although possible, would have been highly challenging in this case.

Computed tomography showed a bilateral 14 colorectal liver metastases which indicated stable disease by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria and optimal morphologic response. A two-stage hepatectomy was performed to complete a curative resection because of the insufficient remnant liver volume. Five partial hepatic resections in the left liver and the right portal vein ligation were performed during the first operation. Thirty-four days later, a right hepatectomy was successfully performed. Pathologically, there was tumor necrosis in 90 percent of the area of the metastasized liver, and viable cells were detected in only a marginal part of the liver.

At presentation, mammary Paget's disease (PD) was clinically suspected. Skin biopsy was performed and showed epidermis invaded by Paget cells, characterized by hyperchromatic nuclei and abundant pale-staining cytoplasm. Computed tomography and mammary ultrasonography confirmed the absence of an underlying invasive carcinoma, and the patient underwent right mastectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB). Both sentinel lymph nodes were found to be negative perioperatively, and further axillary dissection was not performed. Pathological results revealed no malignancy under the nipple, yet the Paget cells were more widely spread than expected. The patient was followed up without the need of postoperative chemotherapy. Male mammary PD is an extremely rare breast cancer, and there is no standard preoperative assessment or operative procedure. Mammography is many times unable to detect possible underlying breast carcinoma in female patients with mammary PD, and previous studies have reported that the detection rate was less than 50\xa0%. However, some researchers reported that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) might be more detectable to confirm the extent of the cancer. The extent of the skin change around the nipple is often different from the actual perimeter of Paget cells. In extra-mammary PD, mapping biopsy is known to be useful to determine areas free of cancer. The benefits of SLNB have also been demonstrated for the management of less invasive breast cancers, and previous reports have shown that the use of SLNB is reasonable for treatment of mammary PD without underlying invasive cancer. MRI, mapping biopsy, and SLNB are all less invasive procedures and thus may be suitable for treatment of male mammary PD.""]"	('Akita', 'Masayuki')	Surgical case reports	Surg Case Rep	['eng']

26943393	2015	03	Thoracoscopic radical esophagectomy and laparoscopic transhiatal lymph node dissection for superficial esophageal cancer associated with lymph node metastases in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta.	['Esophageal cancer invading the muscularis mucosa sometimes involves regional lymph node metastases. However, lymph node metastases are rare in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta. We describe a patient with an intramucosal esophageal cancer invading the muscularis mucosa, accompanied by lymph node metastases in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta. These lesions were successfully resected by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery using a transhiatal approach. A 60-year-old man was diagnosed with superficial esophageal cancer during a routine health examination. Endoscopic examination and ultrasonography revealed a superficial cancer, of diameter 6.0\xa0cm, invading the submucosal layer and intramural metastases caudal to the primary tumor. Enhanced computed tomography and F-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography demonstrated the two metastatic lymph nodes, one in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta and the other near the left gastric artery. Thoracoscopic radical esophagectomy with three-field lymph node dissection was performed. The metastatic lymph node in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta was successfully removed by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery using a transhiatal approach. Histopathological examination showed primary cancer invading the muscularis mucosa and intramural metastases in the lamina propria mucosa and submucosal layer. The pathological diagnosis according to the Japanese classification of esophageal cancer was MtLt, 47\xa0mm, 0-IIa\u2009+\u2009IIb, pT1a-MM, ie(+), INF-b, ly3, v0, pN4(4a), pIM1, M0, and pstage IVa. The patient underwent two courses of adjuvant chemotherapy, consisting of CDDP and 5-fluorouracil. At present, 1\xa0year and 8\xa0months after surgery, the patient remains alive without tumor recurrence. Although the lymph node in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta is not recognized as regional nodes of thoracic esophageal cancer, solitary mediastinal metastases from a mucosal cancer may indicate the existence of direct lymphatic flow from the thoracic esophagus to the retroaortic region. Transhiatal approach by hand-assisted laparoscopic surgery is useful to dissect the metastatic lymph node in the dorsal area of the thoracic aorta.']	('Ninomiya', 'Itasu')	Surgical case reports	Surg Case Rep	['eng']

A year after surgery, an abdominal computed tomography (CT) demonstrated suspicion for peritoneal dissemination with an increase in ascites, and (18)F-fluorodeoxy glucose-positron emission tomography-CT was suggestive of carcinomatosis. We began to decompress the small intestine and administer octreotide. However, the intestinal obstruction did not improve. Although intestinal pseudo-obstruction caused by limited SSc was considered as a differential diagnosis, we performed an exploratory laparotomy because the possibility of peritoneal dissemination-associated obstruction could not be excluded. We observed a moderate amount of serous ascites and dilatation of the small intestine that was white in color, hard, and with limited contractility. There was no evidence of peritoneal dissemination nor of mechanical obstruction. Our experience thus shows the difficulty of distinguishing SSc-associated intestinal pseudo-obstruction from peritoneal dissemination.']	('Saigusa', 'Susumu')	Surgical case reports	Surg Case Rep	['eng']

['Indications for resection of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMNs) remain controversial because of their low tendency to be malignant. Surgical resection should be recommended if any factors indicating malignancy are present. However, preoperative differentiation between benign and malignant tumors is very difficult, especially in cases of branch duct IPMNs. We herein report a case of branch duct intraductal papillary mucinous adenoma (IPMA) of the pancreas with a large mural nodule of 25\xa0mm. A 74-year-old woman was admitted for examination and treatment for a cystic tumor in the head of the pancreas. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography and computed tomography showed a cystic lesion, 50\xa0mm in diameter, with an irregular mural nodule in the pancreatic head. Endoscopic ultrasonography demonstrated a multicystic tumor connected with the main pancreatic duct (MPD). The mural nodule had a diameter of 18\xa0mm, and the MPD had a slight dilation of 6\xa0mm. These findings suggested a high potential for malignancy. The patient underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy with lymph node dissection. The excised pancreas showed multiple cysts located in the branch pancreatic duct with a maximum diameter of 75\xa0mm. The mural nodule had a maximum diameter of 25\xa0mm. The tumor was diagnosed as an IPMA by pathological examination. After operation, the patient was discharged without any complications.

"[""Few reports have described right upper and lower lobectomy with preservation of the middle lobe because of the risk of middle lobe torsion or emphysematous change. Herein we describe a successful result following lobectomy with preservation of the middle lobe for metachronous pulmonary metastasis originating from colon cancer in the right upper lobe after initial right lower lobectomy. A 69-year-old man who had undergone right lower lobectomy for pulmonary metastasis originating from colon cancer 3\xa0years earlier was diagnosed as having suspected metachronous pulmonary metastasis in the right upper lobe. Because preoperative computed tomography (CT) indicated that the distance between the tumor and the entrance of the upper bronchus was 20\xa0mm, it was considered difficult to achieve complete resection by a wedge resection or segmentectomy. Furthermore, preoperative CT demonstrated compensatory hypertrophy of the middle lobe and elevation of the right diaphragm, thus reducing the size of the thorax. Therefore, right upper lobectomy with middle lobe preservation was planned. The operation was performed using a totally thoracoscopic approach. Adhesion of the upper lobe to the chest wall was easily detached. As the middle lobe adhered to the chest wall, this served to prevent middle lobe torsion. The fissure between the upper and middle lobes had fused because of adhesion resulting from the initial lower lobectomy. Therefore, an 'anterior fissureless approach' was adopted to avoid any postoperative air leakage. There were no intraoperative problems, and the postoperative course was uneventful. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 6. Pathological examination of the specimen confirmed that the tumor was a metachronous pulmonary metastasis originating from the colon cancer. Four months after the operation, he had no requirement for additional oxygen support, and postoperative CT demonstrated a sufficiently expanded residual middle lobe without emphysematous change.""]"	('Igai', 'Hitoshi')	Surgical case reports	Surg Case Rep	['eng']

['In a phase IV trial, 84 patients (age 18-79) with acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in first complete remission (CR) received cycles of immunotherapy with histamine dihydrochloride (HDC) and low-dose human recombinant interleukin 2 (IL-2) for 18\xa0months to prevent leukemic relapse. During cycles, the treatment resulted in expansion of CD56(bright) (CD3(-)/16(-)/56(bright)) and CD16(+) (CD3(-)/16(+)/56(+)) natural killer (NK) cells in the blood along with increased NK cell expression of the natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs) NKp30 and NKp46. Multivariate analyses correcting for age and risk group demonstrated that high CD56(bright) NK cell counts and high expression of NKp30 or NKp46 on CD16(+) NK cells independently predicted leukemia-free survival (LFS) and overall survival (OS). Our results suggest that the dynamics of NK cell subsets and their NCR expression may determine the efficiency of relapse-preventive immunotherapy in AML.']	('Martner', 'Anna')	Oncoimmunology	Oncoimmunology	['eng']

Angiogenesis inhibitors have been introduced for the treatment of cancer. Based on the fact that many anticancer agents have been developed from botanical sources, there is a significant untapped resource to be found in natural products. American ginseng is a commonly used herbal medicine in the U.S., which possess antioxidant properties. After oral ingestion, natural ginseng saponins are biotransformed to their metabolites by the enteric microbiome before being absorbed. The major metabolites, ginsenoside Rg3 and compound K, showed significant potent anticancer activity compared to that of their parent ginsenosides Rb1, Rc and Rd. In this review, the molecular mechanisms of ginseng metabolites on cancer chemoprevention, especially apoptosis and angiogenic inhibition, are discussed. Ginseng gut microbiome metabolites showed significant anti-angiogenic effects on pulmonary, gastric and ovarian cancers. This review suggests that in addition to the chemopreventive effects of ginseng compounds, as angiogenic inhibitors, ginsenoside metabolites could be used in combination with other cancer chemotherapeutic agents in cancer management.']	('Wang', 'Chong-Zhi')	Diseases (Basel, Switzerland)	Diseases	['eng']
26941959	2016	08	Understanding inherited genetic risk of adult glioma - a review.	['During the past six years, researchers have made major progress identifying common inherited genetic variation that increases risk for primary adult glioma. This paper summarizes knowledge about rare familial cancer syndromes that include adult glioma and reviews the available literature on the more recently discovered common inherited variation. Ten independent inherited variants in eight chromosomal regions have been convincingly associated with increased risk for adult glioma. Most of these variants increase relative risk of primary adult glioma by 20% to 40%, but the TP53 variant rs78378222 confers a two-fold relative risk (ie, 200%), and rs557505857 on chromosome 8 confers a six-fold relative risk of IDH-mutated astrocytomas and oligodendroglial tumors (ie, 600%). Even with a six-fold relative risk, the overall risk of developing adult glioma is too low for screening for the high-risk variant on chromosome 8. Future studies will help clarify which inherited adult glioma risk variants are associated with subtypes defined by histology and/or acquired tumor mutations. This review also provides an information sheet for primary adult glioma patients and their families.']	('Rice', 'Terri')	Neuro-oncology practice	Neurooncol Pract	['eng']

It is also an efficient way to discover coding SNPs and when multiple individuals with different genetic backgrounds were used, RNA-Seq is very effective for the identification of SNPs. The objective of this study was to perform SNP and INDEL discoveries in human airway transcriptome of healthy never smokers, healthy current smokers, smokers without lung cancer and smokers with lung cancer. By preliminary comparative analysis of these four data sets, it is expected to get SNP and INDEL patterns responsible for lung cancer. A total of 85,028 SNPs and 5738 INDELs in healthy never smokers, 32,671 SNPs and 1561 INDELs in healthy current smokers, 50,205 SNPs and 3008 INDELs in smokers without lung cancer and 51,299 SNPs and 3138 INDELs in smokers with lung cancer were identified. The analysis of the SNPs and INDELs in genes that were reported earlier as differentially expressed was also performed. It has been found that a smoking person has SNPs at position 62,186,542 and 62,190,293 in SCGB1A1 gene and 180,017,251, 180,017,252, and 180,017,597 in SCGB3A1 gene and INDELs at position 35,871,168 in NFKBIA gene and 180,017,797 in SCGB3A1 gene. The SNPs identified in this study provides a resource for genetic studies in smokers and shall contribute to the development of a personalized medicine. This study is only a preliminary kind and more vigorous data analysis and wet lab validation are required.']	('B', 'Sathya')	Applied & translational genomics	Appl Transl Genom	['eng']

"[""Enumerating and analyzing circulating tumor cells (CTCs)-cells that have been shed from primary solid tumors-can potentially be used to determine patient prognosis and track the progression of disease. There is a great challenge to create an effective platform that can isolate these cells, as they are extremely rare: only 1-10 CTCs are present in a 7.5mL of a cancer patient's peripheral blood. We have developed a novel microfluidic system that can isolate CTC populations label free. Our system consists of a multistage separator that employs inertial migration to sort cells based on size.

To determine how aneuploidy affects cellular and organismal physiology, we have developed a system to evaluate aneuploid cell fitness in vivo. By transplanting hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) into recipient mice after ablation of recipient hematopoiesis by lethal irradiation, we can directly compare the fitness of HSCs derived from a range of aneuploid mouse models with that of euploid HSCs. This experimental system can also be adapted to assess the interplay between aneuploidy and tumorigenesis. We hope that further characterization of aneuploid cells in vivo will provide insight both into the origins of hematopoietic phenotypes observed in DS individuals as well as the role of different types of aneuploid cells in the genesis of cancers of the blood.']	('Pfau', 'Sarah J')	Cold Spring Harbor symposia on quantitative biology	Cold Spring Harb.

['The prevention and the early diagnosis of melanoma malignum are essential because of the aggressive spreading and poor therapeutic response of the tumor. Since survival mainly depends on the tumor stage, in the first part of the Ph.D. thesis the stage distribution of melanomas was assessed in the melanoma patients treated at the Department of Dermatology, Dermatooncology and Venerology, Semmelweis University. This work filled a gap, because the Hungarian National Cancer Registry, similarly to other cancer registries, does not include the tumor stages. The results of the assessment showed that most of the patients (43.8%) belonged to stage IA, while only 0.4% of them were in stage IV. In comparison with international studies from Western Europe, Australia and the United States, the distribution of our patients was highly favorable concerning stages IA and IV. To assess the risk of melanoma among special work circumstances (Nuclear Power Plant of Paks) the Department of Dermatology, Dermatooncology and Venerology organized an oncodermatological screening. The results of the screening confirmed that melanoma incidence was not elevated among the nuclear industry workers compared to the general Hungarian population. Among the 556 examined workers we found one melanoma in situ, and the medical history of this patient suggested that UV exposure rather than ionizing radiation could have been the cause of this tumor. Our results also underline the necessity of analyzing skin effects of UV light to avoid false positive correlations. The risk of second primary cancers among melanoma survivors was also assessed in our Department. The findings suggest that the risk of all second primary tumors significantly, 11-15-times increased after having a former melanoma, compared to the general population. The higher risk was mostly caused by the elevated incidence of second primary melanoma and non-melanoma skin cancers. Besides skin tumors, the risk of some internal malignancies was also significantly higher. Our results emphasize that the regular oncologic control is crucial after having melanoma in order to diagnose a second skin or internal malignancy early. Melanoma awareness, primary and secondary prevention programs would be highly necessary to decrease the number of new melanomas, to increase the rate of the early diagnosed tumors and to improve survival.']	('Tóth', 'Veronika')	Magyar onkologia	Magy Onkol	['hun']
26934354	2016	01	[Diagnostic problems and prognostic factors in prostate cancer].	['We aimed to refine the methodology for discriminating ductal (DAP) and acinar adenocarcinomas (AAP) of the prostate preoperatively with a high degree of accuracy, and confirm that prostate carcinoma of ductal origin is a more aggressive subtype. Moreover, we intended to evaluate the clinical utility of transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic sextant or octant biopsies in prediction of extracapsular extension (ECE) at radical prostatectomy. A blinded retrospective analysis of 3-dimensional histology specimens from 110 consecutive radical prostatectomy (RP) cases operated between 2000 and 2006 was carried out (average follow-up: 5.1 years). The samples were also analyzed for 9 different biomarkers. We performed a retrospective analysis of 84 cases of patients who underwent transrectal ultrasound-guided systematic sextant (in 60 cases) or octant (in 24 cases) biopsy. The presence of ECE was correlated to the number of positive biopsies on each side of the prostate by chi-square analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated for both positive (two or three positive biopsies per side) and negative (no or only one positive biopsy per side) test results. The number of positive cores was thereafter combined with two other parameters: prostate-specific antigen (PSA) and Gleason score. 3-dimensional and conventional histology classified 97 cases of AAP and 13 cases of DAP. DAP cases had a significantly greater frequency of pT3a and more advanced cancers (p<0.0001), >20 mm tumor focus (p=0.0020), highgrade PIN (p=0.0079), Gleason score ?7 (p<0.0001), positive surgical margin (p=0.0219), ECE (p<0.0001), vascular invasion (p=0.0033), seminal vesicle infiltration (p=0.0213), biochemical/local recurrence (p=0.0015), regional lymph node metastases and distant metastases (p<0.0001). Three biomarkers in combination (chromogranine A, EGFR, p53) distinguished DAP from AAP with an accuracy of 94% (AUC 0.94; 95% CI: 0.88-0.99). ECE was evidenced at RP in 24% (20/84) of the patients. Chi-square analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between the number of positive biopsies and presence of ECE. Analysis of the 168 prostate sides and dominant sides revealed that systematic needle biopsies had a positive predictive value of 46.7% and 37% and a negative predictive value of 89%, and 94%, respectively. Combination of parameters (biopsy Gleason score ?7 vs. <7, PSA >10 ng/ml vs. ?10 ng/ml and more than one positive cores vs. 0 or 1 positives) identified patients at high or low risk of ECE, respectively. On the extremes, with only lowrisk parameters none of the 10 patients, while 77% of those with high-risk group had ECE at RP. Both 3-dimensional histology and the three selected biomarkers can accurately distinguish DAP from AAP. This discriminatory ability offers AAP cases less radical treatment regimens and emphasizes the need to develop more effective treatment regimens for DAP cases. The probability of ECE at radical prostatectomy can be accurately predicted based on the number of positive sextant and octant biopsies, solely or in combination with other parameters.']	('Tarján', 'Miklós')	Magyar onkologia	Magy Onkol	['hun']
26934349	2016	12	[Immunotherapy opportunities in breast cancer].	['The prognostic value of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes in breast cancer has long been recognized by histopathologists. These observations were reaffirmed by recent immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling studies that also revealed an association between greater chemotherapy sensitivity and extensive lymphocytic infiltration in early stage breast cancers treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These results suggest that local anti-tumor immune response can at least partially control cancer growth and may mediate the antitumor effects of chemotherapy. However, until recently, there was no direct clinical evidence to demonstrate that enhancing anti-tumor immune response could lead to clinical benefit in breast cancer patients. The recent development of clinically effective immune checkpoint inhibitors made it possible to test the therapeutic impact of augmenting the local anti-tumor immune response. Two Phase I clinical trials using single agent anti-PD-1 (MK-3475, pembrolizumab) and anti-PD-L1 (MPDL3280A, atezolizumab) antibodies demonstrated close to 20% tumor response rates in heavily pretreated, metastatic, triple negative breast cancers. The most remarkable feature of the responses was their long duration. Several patients had disease control close to a year, or longer, which has not previously been seen with chemotherapy regimens in this patient population. A large number of clinical trials are currently underway with these and similar drugs in the neoadjuvant, adjuvant and metastatic settings to define the role of this new treatment modality in breast cancer.']	('Pusztai', 'Lajos')	Magyar onkologia	Magy Onkol	['hun']

To enhance their efficacy it is of primary importance to search for biomarkers that could help predict the likelihood of therapeutic effect. Results of studies on potential predictive immunological parameters suggest that the existing antitumor immune activity detectable in the patients, although not sufficient to control tumor progression in itself, could increase the efficacy of different immunotherapies. Moreover, the contribution of immune reactions to the effect of other antitumor treatment modalities as chemo-, radio-, and targeted therapy has also been demonstrated. Combinations of immunotherapies with these and with each other will probably represent treatment approaches resulting in the highest therapeutic effect, which may necessitate the development of biomarker panels with multiple components characterizing the immune status of the patient and the tumor as well.']	('Ladányi', 'Andrea')	Magyar onkologia	Magy Onkol	['hun']

['Despite the fact that G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate numerous physiological processes and represent targets for therapeutics for a vast array of diseases, their role in tumor biology is under appreciated. Protease-activated receptors (PARs) form a family which belongs to GPCR class A. PAR1&2 emerge with a central role in epithelial malignancies. Although the part of PAR1&2 in cancer is on the rise, their underlying signaling events are poorly understood. We review hereby past, present, and future cancer-associated PAR biology. Mainly, their role in physiological (placenta-cytotophobalst) and patho-physiological invasion processes. The identification and characterization of signal pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain-binding motifs established critical sites for breast cancer growth in PAR1&2. Among the proteins found to harbor important PH-domains and are involved in PAR biology are Akt/PKB as also Etk/Bmx and Vav3. A point mutation in PAR2, H349A, but not R352A, abrogated PH-protein association and is sufficient to markedly reduce PAR2-instigated breast tumor growth in vivo as also placental extravillous trophoblast (EVT) invasion in vitro is markedly reduced. Similarly, the PAR1 mutant hPar1-7A, which is unable to bind PH-domain, inhibits mammary tumors and EVT invasion, endowing these motifs with physiological significance and underscoring the importance of these previously unknown PAR1 and PAR2 PH-domain-binding motifs in both pathological and physiological invasion processes.']	('Bar-Shavit', 'R')	Methods in cell biology	Methods Cell Biol.

26928543	2016	12	Assessing Smoothened-mediated Hedgehog signaling in zebrafish.	['Smoothened belongs to the class of atypical G protein-coupled receptors and serves as the transducing molecule in Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Hh proteins comprise a family of secreted, cholesterol-modified ligands, which act both as morphogens and as signaling molecules. Binding of Hh proteins to their direct receptor, the transmembrane protein Patched-1, relieves Smoothened from tonal inhibition by Patched-1 and causes the translocation of Smoothened into the cilium. Here, the Hh signaling cascade is initiated and results in transcriptional activation of Hh target genes such as gli1 or patched-1. This induces a plethora of physiological outcomes including normal embryonic development, but also cancer, which is the reason why scientists aim to develop strategies to manipulate as well as monitor Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling. The zebrafish has emerged as a valuable tool for the assessment of Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling. In this chapter we thus describe how Smoothened-mediated Hh signaling can be monitored and also quantified using zebrafish embryos.']	('Tena', 'Teresa Casar')	Methods in cell biology	Methods Cell Biol.

We conducted a meta-analysis to assess the relationship between the polymorphisms of three microRNAs and esophageal cancer susceptibility. We systematically searched the PubMed and EMBASE databases to screen relevant studies. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to compute the risk of esophageal cancer. Because of the differences in ethnicities, sources of controls, and genotyping methods, the meta-analysis was conducted using a random-effect model regardless of heterogeneity. To further explore potential heterogeneity, we performed subgroup and sensitivity analyses, and publication bias was also evaluated.

26925227	2015	12	Differential analyses for RNA-seq: transcript-level estimates improve gene-level inferences.	['High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-seq) is used extensively to characterize the transcriptome of cells. Many transcriptomic studies aim at comparing either abundance levels or the transcriptome composition between given conditions, and as a first step, the sequencing reads must be used as the basis for abundance quantification of transcriptomic features of interest, such as genes or transcripts. Various quantification approaches have been proposed, ranging from simple counting of reads that overlap given genomic regions to more complex estimation of underlying transcript abundances. In this paper, we show that gene-level abundance estimates and statistical inference offer advantages over transcript-level analyses, in terms of performance and interpretability. We also illustrate that the presence of differential isoform usage can lead to inflated false discovery rates in differential gene expression analyses on simple count matrices but that\xa0this can be addressed by incorporating offsets derived from transcript-level abundance estimates. We also show that the problem is relatively minor in several real data sets. Finally, we provide an R package ( tximport) to help users integrate transcript-level abundance estimates from common quantification pipelines into count-based statistical inference engines.']	('Soneson', 'Charlotte')	F1000Research	F1000Res	['eng']

We performed RNA-seq experiments to study transcriptomes of human Caki-1 cells under real hypoxia and after CoCl 2 treatment. Despite causing transcriptional changes of a much higher order of magnitude for the genes in the hypoxia regulation pathway, CoCl 2 treatment fails to induce alterations in the glycolysis / gluconeogenesis pathway.

['Cell-based screening methods for nuclear receptor ligands that use transgenic plant cells expressing a single human NR may have advantages over other eukaryotic systems which express multiple NRs. For example, signal-to-noise ratio might be improved because ligands would be less likely to bind to other NRs and/or less likely to cause confounding functional changes in plant cells. As a first step toward this aim we have expressed in plants truncated human estrogen receptor (ER) constructs linked to reporters, or selective markers such as luciferase, green fluorescent protein (GFP) and hygromycin. A variety of ligands for the ER (including estradiol and known phytoestrogens) have then been tested for their ability to over-express the linked marker gene(s) which could be measured (luciferase activity), visualized under fluorescent microscopy (GFP activity), or selected on antibiotic-containing media (Hygromycin B). Our results show a close association between the effects of ER ligands in the transgenic plant roots and their effects on native ERs in mammalian cells. With the stable expression of an ERalpha-GFP ligand detection system in A. thaliana, the estradiol- mediated response in transgenic roots is inhibited by an ER partial agonist (tamoxifen) and an antagonist (fulvestrant) at concentrations relevant to their use in breast cancer. We conclude that it is possible to express human NRs in plants in a form that can report on exogenous or endogenous ER ligands and that these constructs have a pharmacology which is relevant to ligands for the native NRs in human cells.']	('Gunjan', 'Samir Kumar')	Plant molecular biology reporter	Plant Mol.

"['In considering the challenges of approaches to clinical imaging, we are faced with choices that sometimes are impacted by rather dogmatic notions about what is a better or worse technology to achieve the most useful diagnostic image for the patient. For example, is PET or SPECT most useful in imaging any particular disease dissemination? The dictatorial approach would be to choose PET, all other matters being equal. But is such a totalitarian attitude toward imaging selection still valid? In the face of new receptor targeted SPECT agents one must consider the remarkable specificity and sensitivity of these agents. (99m)Tc-Tilmanocept is one of the newest of these agents, now approved for guiding sentinel node biopsy (SLNB) in several solid tumors. Tilmanocept has a Kd of 3×10(-11)M, and it specificity for the CD206 receptor is unlike any other agent to date. This coupled with a number of facts, that specific disease-associated macrophages express this receptor (100 to 150 thousand receptors), that the receptor has multiple binding sites for tilmanocept (>2 sites per receptor) and that these receptors are recycled every 15 min to bind more tilmanocept (acting as intracellular ""drug compilers"" of tilmanocept into non-degraded vesicles), gives serious pause as to how we select our approaches to diagnostic imaging. Clinically, the size of SLNs varies greatly, some, anatomically, below the machine resolution of SPECT. Yet, with tilmanocept targeting, the SLNs are highly visible with macrophages stably accruing adequate (99m)Tc-tilmanocept counting statistics, as high target-to-background ratios can compensate for spatial resolution blurring. Importantly, it may be targeted imaging agents per se, again such as tilmanocept, which may significantly shrink any perceived chasm between the imaging technologies and anchor the diagnostic considerations in the targeting and specificity of the agent rather than any lingering dogma about the hardware as the basis for imaging approaches. Beyond the elements of imaging applications of these agents is their evolution to therapeutic agents as well, and even in the neo-logical realm of theranostics. Characteristics of agents such as tilmanocept that exploit the natural history of diseases with remarkably high specificity are the expectations for the future of patient- and disease-centered diagnosis and therapy.']"	('Cope', 'Frederick O')	Nuclear medicine and biology	Nucl.

Those with higher (ie, more proinflammatory) DII scores were more likely to be males, have less than a completed college education, and be younger. In addition, those with higher scores for cognitive restraint for eating or drive for thinness had lower (ie, anti-inflammatory) DII scores. Linear regression analyses indicated that as the DII increased, the AHEI, HEI-2010, and DASH dietary indices decreased (ie, became more unhealthy, all P<.01). The DII is a novel tool that characterizes the inflammatory potential of diet and is grounded in the peer-reviewed literature on diet and inflammation. Findings from the Energy Balance Study indicate that the DII is associated with other dietary indices, but has the added advantage of specifically measuring dietary inflammatory potential, a risk factor for chronic disease.']"	('Wirth', 'Michael D')	Nutrition research (New York, N.Y.)

['Eriocaulon sieboldianum (Sieb. & Zucc. ex Steud.), a genus of Eriocaulon in the Eriocaulaceae family, is an edible and medicinal plant used in traditional Chinese medicine. It was processed into healthcare beverages for expelling wind-heat, protecting eyes, and reducing blood fat. Also, it has been used with other herbs as Traditional Chinese herbal compound to treat cancer as adjuvants in tumor therapy in China. However, the active fractions and precise cellular mechanisms of E. sieboldianum extract remain to be illustrated. The goal of this study was to investigate the effects of the active fraction of E. sieboldianum on the growth of K562 cells and understand the possible mechanisms of its action. Our findings suggested that the fraction E3 of E. sieboldianum could effectively inhibit the activity of Aurora kinase and induce apoptosis via blocking cell cycle, up-regulating the expression of proapoptotic proteins including p53 and Bax and reducing the expression of Bcl-2. The levels of Cytochrome C, cleaved caspase-9, cleaved caspase-3 and cleaved PARP were also found to be increased after treatment with fraction E3 of E. sieboldianum. This study could improve the development of E. sieboldianum and raise its application value in cancer adjuvant therapy.

"[""The purpose of this paper is to determine the phenotypic relationships, and etiologic underpinnings, of cognitive/psychological traits with psychiatric resilience. Resilience was defined as the difference between the twins' total score on a broad measure of internalizing symptoms and their predicted score based on their cumulative exposure to stressful life events (SLEs). Cholesky decompositions were performed in a large twin sample (n=7,500 individuals) to quantify the overlap in genetic and environmental factors between resilience and six traits (neuroticism, optimism, self-esteem, mastery, interpersonal dependency, altruism) in bivariate analyses, and in a multivariate model. On a phenotypic level, each trait accounted for variance in resilience in univariate analyses. In the multivariate regression neuroticism accounted for the majority of the variance and attenuated the relationships between the other traits and resilience. The genetic factors that influence the traits account for between 7-60% of the heritability of resilience. In the multivariate genetic model neuroticism accounted for all of the genetic covariance between the traits and resilience; 40% of the genetic influence on resilience was independent. Neuroticism evidenced the largest phenotypic and genetic relationship with resilience, and accounted for nearly all of the phenotypic and genetic variance between resilience and the other traits.""]"	('Amstadter', 'Ananda B')	Personality and individual differences	Pers Individ Dif	['eng']

Considering the shearing force generated on the cells by the constant flow that is required to produce and maintain a stable gradient, the trajectories of the cell migration will reflect the net result of both shear force generated by flow and the chemotactic force resulting from the chemokine gradient. Moreover, the effects of mutations in chemokine receptors or the presence of inhibitors of intracellular signals required for gradient sensing can be evaluated in real time. We also describe a method to monitor intracellular signals required for cells to alter cell polarity in response to an abrupt switch in gradient direction.

['Chemokines and their receptors take part in many physiological and pathological processes, and their dysregulated expression is linked to chronic inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, immunodeficiencies, and cancer. The chemokine receptors, members of the G protein-coupled receptor family, are integral membrane proteins, with seven-transmembrane domains that bind the chemokines and transmit signals through GTP-binding proteins. Many assays used to study the structure, conformation, or activation mechanism of these receptors are based on ligand-binding measurement, as are techniques to detect new agonists and antagonists that modulate chemokine function. Such methods require labeling of the chemokine and/or its receptor, which can alter their binding characteristics. Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) is a powerful technique for analysis of the interaction between immobilized receptors and ligands in solution, in real time, and without labeling. SPR measurements nonetheless require expression and purification steps that can alter the conformation, stability, and function of the chemokine and/or the chemokine receptor. In this review, we focus on distinct methods to immobilize chemokine receptors on the surface of an optical biosensor. We expose the advantages and disadvantages of different protocols used and describe in detail the method to retain viral particles as receptor carriers that can be used for SPR determinations.']	('Rodríguez-Frade', 'José Miguel')	Methods in enzymology	Meth.

26918123	2015	12	World Health Organization estimates of the global and regional disease burden of four foodborne chemical toxins, 2010: a data synthesis.	"[""Background Chemical exposures have been associated with a variety of health effects; however, little is known about the global disease burden from foodborne chemicals. Food can be a major pathway for the general population's exposure to chemicals, and for some chemicals, it accounts for almost 100% of exposure.\xa0 Methods and Findings Groups of foodborne chemicals, both natural and anthropogenic, were evaluated for their ability to contribute to the burden of disease.\xa0 The results of the analyses on four chemicals are presented here - cyanide in cassava, peanut allergen, aflatoxin, and dioxin.\xa0 Systematic reviews of the literature were conducted to develop age- and sex-specific disease incidence and mortality estimates due to these chemicals.\xa0 From these estimates, the numbers of cases, deaths and disability adjusted life years (DALYs) were calculated.\xa0 For these four chemicals combined, the total number of illnesses, deaths, and DALYs in 2010 is estimated to be 339,000 (95% uncertainty interval [UI]: 186,000-1,239,000); 20,000 (95% UI: 8,000-52,000); and 1,012,000 (95% UI: 562,000-2,822,000), respectively.\xa0 Both cyanide in cassava and aflatoxin are associated with diseases with high case-fatality ratios.\xa0 Virtually all human exposure to these four chemicals is through the food supply.\xa0 Conclusion Chemicals in the food supply, as evidenced by the results for only four chemicals, can have a significant impact on the global burden of disease. The case-fatality rates for these four chemicals range from low (e.g., peanut allergen) to extremely high (aflatoxin and liver cancer).\xa0 The effects associated with these four chemicals are neurologic (cyanide in cassava), cancer (aflatoxin), allergic response (peanut allergen), endocrine (dioxin), and reproductive (dioxin).""]"	('Gibb', 'Herman')	F1000Research	F1000Res	['eng']

['Therapeutic cancer vaccines based on the abnormal glycans expressed on cancer cells, such as the globo H antigen, have witnessed great progress in recent years. For example, the keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH) conjugate of globo H has been on clinical trials as a cancer vaccine. However, such vaccines have intrinsic problems, such as inconsistence in eliciting T cell-mediated immunity in cancer patients and difficult quality control. To address the issue, a structurally defined fully synthetic glycoconjugate vaccine composed of globo H and monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA) was developed. The new vaccine was shown to elicit robust IgG1 antibody responses and T cell-dependent immunity, which is desired for anticancer vaccine, and induce significantly faster and stronger immune responses than the globo H-KLH conjugate. Moreover, it was self-adjuvanting, namely, inducing immune responses without the use of an external adjuvant, thus MPLA was not only a vaccine carrier but also a build-in adjuvant. It was also found that antibodies induced by the new vaccine could selectively bind to and mediate strong complement-dependent cytotoxicity to globo H-expressing MCF-7 cancer cell. All of the results have demonstrated that the globo H-MPLA conjugate is a better cancer vaccine than the globo H-KLH conjugate under experimental conditions and is worth further investigation and development.']	('Zhou', 'Zhifang')	Chemical science	Chem Sci	['eng']

26916007	2016	11	Hsp90: A Global Regulator of the Genotype-to-Phenotype Map in Cancers.	"['Cancer cells have the unusual capacity to limit the cost of the mutation load that they harbor and simultaneously harness its evolutionary potential. This property fuels drug resistance, a key failure mode in oncogene-directed therapy. However, the factors that regulate this capacity might also provide an Achilles\' heel that could be exploited therapeutically. Recently, insight has come from a seemingly distant field: protein folding. It is now clear that protein homeostasis broadly supports malignancy and fuels the rapid evolution of drug resistance. Among protein homeostatic mechanisms that influence cancer biology, the essential ATP-driven molecular chaperone heat-shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is especially important. Hsp90 catalyzes folding of many proteins that regulate growth and development. These ""client"" kinases, transcription factors, and ubiquitin ligases often play critical roles in human disease, especially cancer. Studies in a wide range of systems-from single-celled organisms to human tumor samples-suggest that Hsp90 can broadly reshape the map between genotype and phenotype, acting as a ""capacitor"" and ""potentiator"" of genetic variation. Indeed, it has likely done so to such a degree that it has left an impress on diverse genome sequences. Hsp90 can constitute as much as 5% of total protein in transformed cells and increased levels of heat-shock activation correlate with poor prognosis in breast cancer. These findings and others have motivated a flurry of interest in Hsp90 inhibitors as cancer therapeutics, which have met with rather limited success as single agents, but may eventually prove invaluable in limiting the emergence of resistance to other chemotherapeutics, both genotoxic and molecularly targeted. Here, we provide an overview of Hsp90 function, review its relationship to genetic variation and the evolution of new traits, and discuss the importance of these findings for cancer biology and future efforts to drug this pathway.']"	('Jarosz', 'Daniel')	Advances in cancer research	Adv.

Thus, HSP90 is a high-value target in the development of anticancer therapeutics.

The use of inhibitors of HSP90 as chemical biological probes has been invaluable in revealing important roles for the chaperone in multiple aspects of immune function. Given this critical link, we must now consider the question of how immune outcomes may be affected by the HSP90 inhibitors currently in clinical development for the treatment of cancer. This chapter will review some of the immunological aspects of HSP90 function in terms of its intracellular and extracellular roles in antigen presentation, immune effector cell tasks, and regulation of inflammatory processes.

['As an endoplasmic reticulum heat-shock protein 90 (HSP90) paralog, GRP94 (glucose-regulated protein 94)/gp96 (hereafter referred to as GRP94) has been shown to be an essential master chaperone for multiple receptors including Toll-like receptors, Wnt coreceptors, and integrins. Clinically, expression of GRP94 correlates with advanced stage and poor survival in a variety of cancers. Recent preclinical studies have also revealed that GRP94 expression is closely linked to cancer growth and metastasis in melanoma, ovarian cancer, multiple myeloma, lung cancer, and inflammation-associated colon cancer. Thus, GRP94 is an attractive therapeutic target in a number of malignancies. The chaperone function of GRP94 depends on its ATPase domain, which is structurally distinct from HSP90, allowing design of highly selective GRP94-targeted inhibitors. In this chapter, we discuss the biology and structure-function relationship of GRP94. We also summarize the immunological roles of GRP94 based on the studies documented over the last two decades, as these pertain to tumorigenesis and cancer progression. Finally, the structure-based rationale for the design of selective small-molecule inhibitors of GRP94 and their potential application in the treatment of cancer are highlighted.']	('Wu', 'Bill X')	Advances in cancer research	Adv.

"[""The cellular functions of Hsp90 have historically been attributed to its ability to chaperone client proteins involved in signal transduction. Although numerous stimuli and the signaling cascades they activate contribute to cancer progression, many of these pathways ultimately require transcriptional effectors to elicit tumor-promoting effects. Despite this obvious connection, the majority of studies evaluating Hsp90 function in malignancy have focused upon its regulation of cytosolic client proteins, and particularly members of receptor and/or kinase families. However, in recent years, Hsp90 has emerged as a pivotal orchestrator of nuclear events. Discovery of an expanding repertoire of Hsp90 clients has illuminated a vital role for Hsp90 in overseeing nuclear events and influencing gene transcription. Hence, this chapter will cast a spotlight upon several regulatory themes involving Hsp90-dependent nuclear functions. Highlighted topics include a summary of chaperone-dependent regulation of key transcription factors (TFs) and epigenetic effectors in malignancy, as well as a discussion of how the complex interplay among a subset of these TFs and epigenetic regulators may generate feed-forward loops that further support cancer progression. This chapter will also highlight less recognized indirect mechanisms whereby Hsp90-supported signaling may impinge upon epigenetic regulation. Finally, the relevance of these nuclear events is discussed within the framework of Hsp90's capacity to enable phenotypic variation and drug resistance. These newly acquired insights expanding our understanding of Hsp90 function support the collective notion that nuclear clients are major beneficiaries of Hsp90 action, and their impairment is likely responsible for many of the anticancer effects elicited by Hsp90-targeted approaches.""]"	('Isaacs', 'Jennifer S')	Advances in cancer research	Adv.

Hsp90 functions both in regulating the activity of sequence-specific transcription factors such as nuclear receptors and HSF1, as well as impacting more globally acting factors that act on chromatin and RNA polymerase II. Hsp90 influences transcription by modulating histone modification mediated by its clients SMYD3 and trithorax/MLL, as well as by regulating the processivity of RNA polymerase II through negative elongation factor. It is not currently clear how the transcriptional role of Hsp90 may be influenced by the cancer milieu although recently discovered posttranslational modification of the chaperone may be involved.

"['Molecular chaperones are essential for guarding proteins that are indispensable for normal cellular functions. Heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90) is a vital molecular chaperone in eukaryotes that participates in stabilizing and activating approximately 200 target proteins, called ""clients,"" many of which are involved in signal transduction pathways. Cancer cells however utilize Hsp90 to chaperone an array of mutated and overexpressed oncoproteins to protect them from misfolding and degradation. Therefore, Hsp90 is an attractive target in cancer therapy. Hsp90 chaperone function relies on ATP binding and hydrolysis, which in turn guides its carefully orchestrated conformational changes. This chaperone cycle is fine-tuned by another group of proteins called co-chaperones. They are able to accelerate or decelerate the cycle, allowing Hsp90 to chaperone different clients. Posttranslational modifications (PTMs) can also regulate the chaperone cycle at an epigenetic level thereby tailoring Hsp90 function to suit a specific cell type or environmental condition. Recent evidence suggests that inhibition of the enzymes that catalyze the PTM of Hsp90 can act synergistically with Hsp90 inhibitors, providing a novel therapeutic strategy to enhance the efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors in cancer cells.']"	('Woodford', 'Mark R')	Advances in cancer research	Adv.

Work over the last two decades has demonstrated that many cancer-related proteins are Hsp90 clients, and yet only few of them have been extensively investigated, selected either on the basis of their obvious function as cancer drivers or because they proved to be convenient biomarkers for monitoring the effects of Hsp90 inhibitors.

['Obesity is associated with the impairment of endothelial function leading to the initiation of the atherosclerotic process. As obesity is a multiple grade disease, we have hypothesized that an increasing impairment of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell functions occurs from lean subjects to severe obese ones, creating a window of opportunities for preventive measures. Thus, the present study was carried out to investigate the grade of obesity in which endothelial dysfunction can be detected and if there is an increasing impairment of endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell functions as body mass index increases. According to body mass index, subjects were allocated into five groups: Lean controls (n = 9); Overweight (n = 11); Obese class I (n = 26); Obese class II (n = 15); Obese class III (n = 19). Endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cell functions were evaluated measuring forearm blood flow responses to increasing intra-arterial infusions of acetylcholine and sodium nitroprusside using venous occlusion plethysmography. We observed that forearm blood flow was progressively impaired from lean controls to severe obese and found no significant differences between Lean controls and Overweight groups. Known determinants of endothelial dysfunction, such as inflammatory response, insulin resistance, and diagnosis of metabolic syndrome, did not correlate with forearm blood flow response to vasodilators. Moreover, several risk factors for atherosclerosis were excluded as independent predictors after confounder-adjusted analysis. Our data suggests that obesity per se could be sufficient to promote impairment of vascular reactivity, that obesity class I is the first grade of obesity in which endothelial dysfunction can be detected, and that body mass index positively correlates with the worsening of endothelium-dependent and independent changes in forearm blood flow.']	('Kraemer-Aguiar', 'Luiz G')	Frontiers in physiology	Front Physiol	['eng']

['Generation of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells and cancer biogenesis share similar metabolic switches. Most studies have focused on how the establishment of a cancer-like glycolytic phenotype is necessary for the optimal routing of somatic cells for achieving stemness. However, relatively little effort has been dedicated towards elucidating how one-carbon (1C) metabolism is retuned during acquisition of stem cell identity. Here we used ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography coupled to an electrospray ionization source and a triple-quadrupole mass spectrometer [UHPLC-ESI-QqQ-MS/MS] to quantitatively examine the methionine/folate bi-cyclic 1C metabolome during nuclear reprogramming of somatic cells into iPS cells. iPS cells optimize the synthesis of the universal methyl donor S-adenosylmethionine (SAM), apparently augment the ability of the redox balance regulator NADPH in SAM biosynthesis, and greatly increase their methylation potential by triggering a high SAM:S-adenosylhomocysteine (SAH) ratio. Activation of the methylation cycle in iPS cells efficiently prevents the elevation of homocysteine (Hcy), which could alter global DNA methylation and induce mitochondrial toxicity, oxidative stress and inflammation. In this regard, the methyl donor choline is also strikingly accumulated in iPS cells, suggesting perhaps an overactive intersection of the de novo synthesis of choline with the methionine-Hcy cycle. Activation of methylogenesis and maintenance of an optimal SAM:Hcy ratio might represent an essential function of 1C metabolism to provide a labile pool of methyl groups and NADPH-dependent redox products required for successfully establishing and maintaining an embryonic-like DNA methylation imprint in stem cell states.']	('Fernández-Arroyo', 'Salvador')	Oncoscience	Oncoscience	['eng']

26909336	2016	12	Copy number variants associated with 18p11.32, DCC and the promoter 1B region of APC in colorectal polyposis patients.	['Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) is the second most common inherited predisposition to colorectal cancer (CRC) associated with the development of hundreds to thousands of adenomas in the colon and rectum. Mutations in APC are found in ~\xa080% polyposis patients with FAP. In the remaining 20% no genetic diagnosis can be provided suggesting other genes or mechanisms that render APC inactive may be responsible. Copy number variants (CNVs) remain to be investigated in FAP and may account for disease in a proportion of polyposis patients. A cohort of 56 polyposis patients and 40 controls were screened for CNVs using the 2.7M microarray (Affymetrix) with data analysed using ChAS (Affymetrix). A total of 142 CNVs were identified unique to the polyposis cohort suggesting their involvement in CRC risk. We specifically identified CNVs in four unrelated polyposis patients among CRC susceptibility genes APC, DCC, MLH1 and CTNNB1 which are likely to have contributed to disease development in these patients. A recurrent deletion was observed at position 18p11.32 in 9% of the patients screened that was of particular interest. Further investigation is necessary to fully understand the role of these variants in CRC risk given the high prevalence among the patients screened.']	('Masson', 'Amy L')	Meta gene	Meta Gene	['eng']

Since there are no specific limits for benzene levels in beverages and food in general studies have adopted references for drinking water in a range from 1-10\u2009ppb. The presence of benzene has been reported in various food/beverage substances with soft drinks often reported in the literature. Although the analyses reported low levels of benzene in most of the samples studied, some exceeded permissible limits. The available data on dietary exposure to benzene is minimal from the viewpoint of public health.

26904394	2016	07	Regulation of AMP-activated protein kinase by natural and synthetic activators.	['The AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) is a sensor of cellular energy status that is almost universally expressed in eukaryotic cells. While it appears to have evolved in single-celled eukaryotes to regulate energy balance in a cell-autonomous manner, during the evolution of multicellular animals its role has become adapted so that it also regulates energy balance at the whole body level, by responding to hormones that act primarily on the hypothalamus. AMPK monitors energy balance at the cellular level by sensing the ratios of AMP/ATP and ADP/ATP, and recent structural analyses of the AMPK heterotrimer that have provided insight into the complex mechanisms for these effects will be discussed. Given the central importance of energy balance in diseases that are major causes of morbidity or death in humans, such as type 2 diabetes, cancer and inflammatory disorders, there has been a major drive to develop pharmacological activators of AMPK. Many such activators have been described, and the various mechanisms by which these activate AMPK will be discussed. A particularly large class of AMPK activators are natural products of plants derived from traditional herbal medicines. While the mechanism by which most of these activate AMPK has not yet been addressed, I will argue that many of them may be defensive compounds produced by plants to deter infection by pathogens or grazing by insects or herbivores, and that many of them will turn out to be inhibitors of mitochondrial function.']	('Grahame Hardie', 'David')	Acta pharmaceutica Sinica.

The incident X-ray beams of energies tuned to spectroscopic features of the near-edge region of sulfur K-edge absorption spectra were used to provide contrast between chemical species presented in the tissue. Next, the relative content of the three main sulfur forms, found in biological systems, was calculated and the results are presented in a form of 2D color maps. These maps are correlated with the microscopic histological image of the scanned area.The main findings show that sulfur occurs in prostate tissue mainly in reduced form.

We present a safe endobag abdominal morcellation in a single port-access laparoscopy subtotal hysterectomy. The endobag abdominal morcellation is feasible and safe; consequently, the development of devices dedicated to intracavitary morcellation in a closed system has been encouraged.']	('Angioni', 'Stefano')	Minimally invasive therapy & allied technologies : MITAT : official journal of the Society for Minimally Invasive Therapy	Minim Invasive Ther Allied Technol	['eng']

['Cis-diamminedichloroplatinum (II) (cisplatin) is the most widely used chemotherapeutic drug for various cancers, but its effectiveness is limited by tumor cell resistance and the severe side effects it causes.

To achieve our goal, human leukemia (HL-60) cells were treated with different doses (1, 2, or 3 µM) of cisplatin for 24, 48, 72 and 96 hours. Cell viability was assessed by MTS assay. Both oxidative stress damage and genotoxicity were estimated by antioxidants, lipid peroxidation, and comet assays, respectively. Data obtained from the MTS assay demonstrated that cisplatin treatment decreased the number of viable tumor cells by direct cell killing or by simply decreasing the rate of cellular proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The results of the lipid peroxidation showed a significant increase (p<0.05) of malondialdehyde levels with increasing cisplatin doses. Results obtained from super oxide dismutase and catalase assays showed a gradual increase in antioxidant enzyme activity in cisplatin-treated cells compared to control cells. Data generated from the Comet assay demonstrated a significant dose-dependent increase in genotoxicity with respect to DNA damage as a result of cisplatin treatment. Taken together, our research demonstrated that cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity in HL-60 cells is mediated at least in part via induction of oxidative stress and oxidative damage.']	('Dasari', 'Shaloam R')	International journal of cancer research and molecular mechanisms	Int J Cancer Res Mol Mech	['eng']

26900431	2015	11	The role of purinergic receptors in stem cell differentiation.	['A major challenge modern society has to face is the increasing need for tissue regeneration due to degenerative diseases or tumors, but also accidents or warlike conflicts. There is great hope that stem cell-based therapies might improve current treatments of cardiovascular diseases, osteochondral defects or nerve injury due to the unique properties of stem cells such as their self-renewal and differentiation potential. Since embryonic stem cells raise severe ethical concerns and are prone to teratoma formation, adult stem cells are still in the focus of research. Emphasis is placed on cellular signaling within these cells and in between them for a better understanding of the complex processes regulating stem cell fate. One of the oldest signaling systems is based on nucleotides as ligands for purinergic receptors playing an important role in a huge variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, migration and differentiation. Besides their natural ligands, several artificial agonists and antagonists have been identified for P1 and P2 receptors and are already used as drugs. This review outlines purinergic receptor expression and signaling in stem cells metabolism. We will briefly describe current findings in embryonic and induced pluripotent stem cells as well as in cancer-, hematopoietic-, and neural crest-derived stem cells. The major focus will be placed on recent findings of purinergic signaling in mesenchymal stem cells addressed in in vitro and in vivo studies, since stem cell fate might be manipulated by this system guiding differentiation towards the desired lineage in the future.']	('Kaebisch', 'Constanze')	Computational and structural biotechnology journal	Comput Struct Biotechnol J	['eng']
26900396	2015	10	Nanoscale Assemblies of Small Molecules Control the Fate of Cells.	['Being driven by non-covalent interactions, the formation of functional assemblies (or aggregates) of small molecules at nanoscale is a more common process in water than one would think. While most efforts on self-assembly in cellular environment concentrate on the assemblies of proteins (e.g., microtubules or amyloid fibers), nanoscale assemblies of small molecules are emerging functional entities that exhibit important biological function in cellular environments. This review describes the increasing efforts on the exploration of nanoscale assemblies of small molecules that largely originate from the serendipitous observations in research fields other than nanoscience and technology. Specifically, we describe that nanoscale assemblies of small molecules exhibit unique biological functions in extracellular and intracellular environment, thus inducing various cellular responses, like causing cell death or promoting cell proliferation. We first survey certain common feature of nanoscale molecular assemblies, then discuss several specific examples, such as, nanoscale assemblies of small peptides accumulated in the cells for selectively inhibiting cancer cells via promiscuous interactions with proteins, and nanoscale assemblies of a glycoconjugate for promoting the proliferation of stem cells or for suppressing immune responses. Subsequently, we emphasize the spatiotemporal control of nanoscale assemblies for controlling the cell fate, particularly illustrate a paradigm-shifting approach-enzyme-instructed self-assembly (EISA), that is, the integration of enzymatic reaction and self-assembly-for generating nanoscale assemblies from innocuous monomers for selectively inhibiting cancer cells. Moreover, we introduce a convenient assay for proteomic study of the proteins that interact with nanoscale assemblies of small molecules in cellular environment. Furthermore, we introduce the use of ligand-receptor interaction to catalyze the formation of nanoscale assemblies. By illustrating these experimental strategies for controlling the formation of nanoscale assemblies of small molecules and for identifying their corresponding protein targets, we aim to highlight that, though not being defined at the genetic level, nanoscale assemblies of small molecules are able to perform many critical biological functions. We envision that nanoscale assemblies of small molecules are a new frontier at the intersection of nanoscience and cell biology and biomedicine. In addition, we discuss the challenges and perspectives of relevant potential biomedical applications of nanoscale assemblies of small molecules.']	('Shi', 'Junfeng')	Nano today	Nano Today	['eng']

26900203	2015	03	A Combination of Spatial and Recursive Temporal Filtering for Noise Reduction when Using Region of Interest (ROI) Fluoroscopy for Patient Dose Reduction in Image Guided Vascular Interventions with Significant Anatomical Motion.	['Because x-ray based image-guided vascular interventions are minimally invasive they are currently the most preferred method of treating disorders such as stroke, arterial stenosis, and aneurysms; however, the x-ray exposure to the patient during long image-guided interventional procedures could cause harmful effects such as cancer in the long run and even tissue damage in the short term. ROI fluoroscopy reduces patient dose by differentially attenuating the incident x-rays outside the region-of-interest. To reduce the noise in the dose-reduced regions previously recursive temporal filtering was successfully demonstrated for neurovascular interventions. However, in cardiac interventions, anatomical motion is significant and excessive recursive filtering could cause blur. In this work the effects of three noise-reduction schemes, including recursive temporal filtering, spatial mean filtering, and a combination of spatial and recursive temporal filtering, were investigated in a simulated ROI dose-reduced cardiac intervention. First a model to simulate the aortic arch and its movement was built. A coronary stent was used to simulate a bio-prosthetic valve used in TAVR procedures and was deployed under dose-reduced ROI fluoroscopy during the simulated heart motion. The images were then retrospectively processed for noise reduction in the periphery, using recursive temporal filtering, spatial filtering and a combination of both. Quantitative metrics for all three noise reduction schemes are calculated and are presented as results. From these it can be concluded that with significant anatomical motion, a combination of spatial and recursive temporal filtering scheme is best suited for reducing the excess quantum noise in the periphery. This new noise-reduction technique in combination with ROI fluoroscopy has the potential for substantial patient-dose savings in cardiac interventions.']	('Nagesh', 'S V Setlur')	Proceedings of SPIE--the International Society for Optical Engineering	Proc SPIE Int Soc Opt Eng	['eng']

['The clinical significance of resistance/intolerance to hydroxycarbamide (HC) was assessed in a series of 890 patients with polycythaemia vera (PV). Resistance/intolerance to HC was recorded in 137 patients (15·4%), consisting of: need for phlebotomies (3·3%), uncontrolled myeloproliferation (1·6%), failure to reduce massive splenomegaly (0·8%), development of cytopenia at the lowest dose of HC to achieve a response (1·7%) and extra-haematological toxicity (9%). With a median follow-up of 4·6 years, 99 patients died, resulting in a median survival of 19 years. Fulfilling any of the resistance/intolerance criteria had no impact on survival but when the different criteria were individually assessed, an increased risk of death was observed in patients developing cytopenia [Hazard ratio (HR): 3·5, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1·5-8·3, P = 0·003].

"[""In childhood acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), central nervous system (CNS) involvement is rare at diagnosis (1-4%), but more frequent at relapse (~30%). Because of the significant late sequelae of CNS treatment, early identification of patients at risk of CNS relapse is crucial. Using microarray-analysis, we discovered multiple differentially expressed genes between B-cell precursor (BCP) ALL cells in bone marrow (BM) and BCP-ALL cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the time of isolated CNS relapse. After confirmation by real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction, selected genes (including SCD and SPP1) were validated at the protein level by flowcytometric analysis of BCP-ALL cells in CSF. Further flowcytometric validation showed that a subpopulation of BCP-ALL cells (>1%) with a 'CNS protein profile' (SCD positivity and increased SPP1 expression) was present in the BM at diagnosis in patients who later developed an isolated CNS relapse, whereas this subpopulation was <1% or absent in all other patients. These data indicate that the presence of a (small) subpopulation of BCP-ALL cells with a 'CNS protein profile' at diagnosis (particularly SCD-positivity) is associated with isolated CNS relapse. Such information can be used to design new diagnostic and treatment strategies that aim at prevention of CNS relapse with reduced toxicity.""]"	('van der Velden', 'Vincent H J')	British journal of haematology	Br.

['Among diverse subject areas in the field of prostate cancer management, treatment-related sexual dysfunction complications persist today as a significant potential problem for all men receiving treatment for this disease. The conjecture that African-American men are disproportionately affected by this problem among ethnic groups is not trivial and warrants attention in view of the possibility that its risk profile, whether real or perceived, may influence clinical management decisions impacting survival outcomes in this high-prostate cancer-risk population. A literature review was performed to define the occurrence and significance of sexual dysfunction after prostate cancer treatment in African-American men, with an emphasis on clinically localized treatment. Data retrieved from population-based as well as single-center investigations are conflicting with regard to the extent and quality of life relevance of sexual dysfunction following prostate cancer treatments in African-American men, relative to that of ethnically different counterparts. Some reports suggest a relatively greater trend in African-American men than other ethnic groups toward obtaining clinical management for sexual dysfunction and experiencing psychosocial effects from it, lending additional support for the possibly greater effect of this problem in African-American men. Although further studies are needed to define sexual dysfunction after prostate cancer treatment and ascertain its bother and impact on quality of life in African-American men, survivorship care that encompasses sexual dysfunction management should proceed with appropriate attention given to cultural, educational, and psychosocial variables.']	('Burnett', 'Arthur L')	Journal of racial and ethnic health disparities	J Racial Ethn Health Disparities	['eng']

26895668	2016	11	Allicin inhibits lymphangiogenesis through suppressing activation of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor.	['Allicin, the most abundant organosulfur compound in freshly crushed garlic tissues, has been shown to have various health-promoting effects, including anticancer actions. A better understanding of the effects and mechanisms of allicin on tumorigenesis could facilitate development of allicin or garlic products for cancer prevention. Here we found that allicin inhibited lymphangiogenesis, which is a critical cellular process implicated in tumor metastasis. In primary human lymphatic endothelial cells, allicin at 10 ?M inhibited capillary-like tube formation and cell migration, and it suppressed phosphorylation of vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 and focal adhesion kinase. Using a Matrigel plug assay in mice, addition of 10 ?g allicin in Matrigel plug inhibited 40-50% of vascular endothelial growth factor-C-induced infiltration of lymphatic endothelial cells and leukocytes. S-Allylmercaptoglutathione, a major cellular metabolite of allicin, had no effect on lymphangiogenic responses in lymphatic endothelial cells. Together, these results demonstrate the antilymphangiogenic effect of allicin in vitro and in vivo, suggesting a novel mechanism for the health-promoting effects of garlic compounds.']	('Wang', 'Weicang')	The Journal of nutritional biochemistry	J.

26895667	2016	11	In utero exposure of rats to high-fat diets perturbs gene expression profiles and cancer susceptibility of prepubertal mammary glands.	['Human studies suggest that high-fat diets (HFDs) increase the risk of breast cancer. The 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA)-induced mammary carcinogenesis rat model is commonly used to evaluate the effects of lifestyle factors such as HFD on mammary tumor risk. Past studies focused primarily on the effects of continuous maternal exposure on the risk of offspring at the end of puberty (PND50). We assessed the effects of prenatal HFD exposure on cancer susceptibility in prepubertal mammary glands and identified key gene networks associated with such disruption. During pregnancy, dams were fed AIN-93G-based diets with isocaloric high olive oil, butterfat or safflower oil. The control group received AIN-93G. Female offspring were treated with DMBA on PND21. However, a significant increase in tumor volume and a trend of shortened tumor latency were observed in rats with HFD exposure against the controls (P=.048 and P=.067, respectively). Large-volume tumors harbored carcinoma in situ. Transcriptome profiling identified 43 differentially expressed genes in the mammary glands of the HFBUTTER group as compared with control. Rapid hormone signaling was the most dysregulated pathway. The diet also induced aberrant expression of Dnmt3a, Mbd1 and Mbd3, consistent with potential epigenetic disruption. Collectively, these findings provide the first evidence supporting susceptibility of prepubertal mammary glands to DMBA-induced tumorigenesis that can be modulated by dietary fat that involves aberrant gene expression and likely epigenetic dysregulation.']	('Govindarajah', 'Vinothini')	The Journal of nutritional biochemistry	J.

26895662	2016	11	Effects of folylpolyglutamate synthase modulation on global and gene-specific DNA methylation and gene expression in human colon and breast cancer cells.	['Folylpolyglutamate synthase (FPGS) plays a critical role in intracellular folate homeostasis. FPGS-induced polyglutamylated folates are better substrates for several enzymes involved in the generation of S-adenosylmethionine, the primary methyl group donor, and hence FPGS modulation may affect DNA methylation. DNA methylation is an important epigenetic determinant in gene expression and aberrant DNA methylation is mechanistically linked cancer development. We investigated whether FPGS modulation would affect global and gene-specific promoter DNA methylation with consequent functional effects on gene expression profiles in HCT116 colon and MDA-MB-435 breast cancer cells. Although FPGS modulation altered global DNA methylation and DNA methyltransferases (DNMT) activity, the effects of FPGS modulation on global DNA methylation and DNMT activity could not be solely explained by intracellular folate concentrations and content of long-chain folylpolyglutamates, and it may be cell-specific. FPGS modulation influenced differential gene expression and promoter cytosine-guanine dinucleotide sequences (CpG) DNA methylation involved in cellular development, cell cycle, cell death and molecular transport. Some of the altered gene expression was associated with promoter CpG DNA methylation changes. In both the FPGS-overexpressed HCT116 and MDA-MB-435 cell lines, we identified several differentially expressed genes involved in folate biosynthesis and one-carbon metabolism, which might in part have contributed to the observed increased efficacy of 5-fluorouracil in response to FPGS overexpression. Our data suggest that FPGS modulation affects global and promoter CpG DNA methylation and expression of several genes involved in important biological pathways. The potential role of FPGS modulation in DNA methylation and its associated downstream functional effects warrants further studies.']	('Kim', 'Sung-Eun')	The Journal of nutritional biochemistry	J.

The proportion of high-dose cisplatin-tolerant patients (cumulative cisplatin dose, ?200 mg/m2) was determined, and the predictive factors of cisplatin tolerance were analyzed in a logistic regression analysis. Between June 2006 and March 2013, a total of 159 patients were treated with CCRT. The median follow-up time was 36.7 months.

['Gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) and connexin (Cx) expression were reported in association with carcinogenesis in various types of tumours. In an earlier histomorphometric study, the protein levels of Cx subtypes 26, 43 and 45 were differentially expressed in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC), corresponding lymph node metastases and dysplasia-free oral mucosa. Moreover, membrane Cx43 acted as an independent prognostic marker in OSCC tissues. This study aimed to confirm the expression of described Cx subtypes at the mRNA level. Hence, a reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analysis of Cx26, Cx43 and Cx45 gene expressions was performed in paired carcinoma and mucosa samples of 15 OSCC patients. Additionally, we assessed the interaction between Cx subtype expression and clinicopathological routine parameters. The RT-qPCR analysis revealed that Cx26 was downregulated in OSCC (P=0.01), while Cx43 was marginally upregulated in cancer tissue (P=0.04). Cx45 was significantly overexpressed in OSCC tissue compared with the intraoral mucosa controls (P<0.01), and remained unchanged at different tumour stages. No significant interactions between differential Cx subtype expression and clinicopathological routine parameters were observed. In conclusion, Cx regulation at the transcriptional level appears to be an early event during the initiation and development of OSCC, and is maintained during further progression. However, the mRNA-protein correlation is variable. This may be indicative of post-transcriptional, translational and degradation regulations being associated with the determination of Cx protein concentration during oral carcinogenesis.']	('Brockmeyer', 'Phillipp')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

['The aim of the present study was to clarify the therapeutic effect of thoracoscopic esophagectomy with radical lymph node dissection based on the recurrence pattern, and identify the risk factors for relapse-free survival in patients with esophageal cancer. The recurrence patterns in 140 patients who underwent complete thoracoscopic radical esophagectomy between January 2003 and December 2012 were investigated. The risk factors for recurrence were examined by univariate and multivariate analysis. Mediastinal recurrence in association with initial lymphatic metastasis was precisely analyzed. Esophageal cancer recurred in 49 (35.0%) of the 140 patients. The median recurrence time was 259 (45-2,560) days after the initial treatment. The patterns of initial recurrence among the 140 patients included hematological recurrence in 24 patients (17.1%), lymphatic recurrence in 26 (18.6%), pleural dissemination in 5 (3.6%), peritoneal dissemination in 2 (1.4%), and local recurrence in 4 (2.9%). Lymphatic recurrence within the mediastinal regional lymphatic stations occurred in only 8 (5.7%) of the 140 patients. Univariate analysis for relapse-free survival showed that the statistically significant variables were a tumor location in the upper third of the esophagus, stage of pT3 or pT4, presence of nodal metastasis, pStage of III or IV, presence of a residual tumor, performance of preoperative chemotherapy and performance of postoperative therapy. Multivariate analysis showed that only nodal metastasis and a positive residual tumor were statistically significant independent risk factors for relapse-free survival. Lymphatic recurrence within the mediastinum, particularly the station around the bilateral recurrent laryngeal nerves, was infrequent and independent of the initial metastatic distribution. Thoracoscopic esophagectomy with radical lymph node dissection provides favorable locoregional control. Lymphatic recurrence within the mediastinal regional nodes is infrequent and independent of the initial lymph node metastasis. A pathological residual tumor and lymph node metastasis are significant risk factors for recurrence.']	('Ninomiya', 'Itasu')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

CBCT images were obtained daily after set-up and the bladder, rectum and vagina were contoured on each CBCT scan. All the contours were transferred to the planning CT following image fusion. Interfractional variations in pelvic organs were assessed with CBCT based on two reference lines, which were identified as A (the midsaggital line across the superior border of pubic symphysis) and B (a parallel line 1.5 cm above line A). The mean volume (range) of the bladder and rectum was 156.5 (1.7-626.5) and 48.2 (11.3-139.7) ml, respectively. The uniform planning target volume (PTV) margin of 10 mm failed to encompass the vagina in 17.3 and 18.1% of the fractions on lines A and B, respectively. The motion of the vagina (standard deviation) was 0.3 (0.3) and 0.1 (0.5) cm on lines A and B, respectively. The anteroposterior dimension and position of the vagina were significantly affected by the filling status of the bladder (P<0.05), but not by that of the rectum.

['Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) are mesenchymal tumors that mainly arise in the gastrointestinal tract. They are usually asymptomatic and are incidentally discovered during endoscopy or surgery. Diagnosis is confirmed by histological examination of the specimen. This is the case report of an asymptomatic GIST of the small intestine diagnosed by wireless capsule endoscopy. The tumor was initially suspected to be a leiomyoma, as GISTs in young adults are rare and are mainly discovered incidentally during colorectal cancer screening. The patient was a 35-year-old woman with occult gastrointestinal bleeding, with a normal medical history. An endoscopic assessment of the upper and lower GI tract (gastroscopy and colonoscopy) was performed, but did not reveal any abnormalities. Subsequently, an exophytic tumor initially suspected as leiomyoma or external pressure was detected in the small intestine by capsule endoscopy. A computed tomography scan was suggestive of a soft tissue tumor arising from the small intestine. A surgical specimen was obtained and the immunohistochemical examination revealed that the tumor was positive for CD117 and discovered on GIST-1 markers, while the markers of carcinoma, melanoma and lymphoma were negative, which was consistent with a diagnosis of a low-risk GIST with a mitotic count of <5/50 high-power fields. In this study, we aimed to present in detail the capsule endoscopic and radiological characteristics, as well as the findings of the histological examination of the surgical specimen. In conclusion, when occult blood is detected in the stool, even when gastroscopy and colonoscopy reveal no abnormal findings, small intestinal lesions should be suspected. Exophytic small intestinal GISTs, although rare, particularly in younger patients, they should be considered by physicians in the differential diagnosis of obscure GI bleeding of unknown origin, in order to reduce morbidity and mortality. Capsule endoscopy may be considered to be the first choice as a diagnostic tool for obscure GI bleeding.']	('Xu', 'Xiaoling')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

This retrospective analysis included 348 patients with NSCLC who underwent surgery following chemotherapy at the Shanghai Pulmonary Hospital, Tongji University School of Medicine, between 1995 and 2012. According to the results of the imaging examinations and postoperative pathology, the patients were divided into three groups, namely groups I (nodal downstaging, pN0-1), II (expected persistent N2 disease) and III (unexpected persistent N2 disease). The rates of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to identify the independent risk factors for OS and DFS. The mortality rate was 1.1% during the postoperative period. Perioperative complications occurred in 45 patients (12.9%). The 5-year OS rate was 32.2, 6.3 and 25.9% in groups I, II and III, respectively (group I vs. III, P=0.023; and group III vs. II, P<0.001).

A retrospective study of 399 consecutive patients (1987-1994) who underwent hepatic resection for HCC in Sun Yat-Sen University Cancer Centre was performed. Serum HGB and MCH levels were examined preoperatively, and their prognostic capabilities were evaluated by Cox's proportional hazard model. Among the whole cohort, the HGB level appeared to be positively correlated with the MCH level (P<0.001). Survival analysis revealed that low levels of HGB (P=0.007) and MCH (P<0.001) were correlated with shorter overall survival (OS). Multivariate analysis revealed that MCH level was independently associated with OS (P<0.001), however, not HGB (P=0.278). In addition, 129 patients with large HCC (?10 cm) tended to have a poorer OS (P<0.001) when compared with patients with smaller HCC. On subanalysis of patients with large HCC, MCH level also retained its stratified significance (P=0.001).

Meta-regression and subgroup analyses were performed to identify the source of heterogeneity. Finally, five studies with 1,419 cases and 1,707 controls were included for the p53 polymorphism and three studies with 837 cases and 1,299 controls were included for the GSTM1 polymorphism. Regarding p53, a significantly increased NPC risk was observed in the overall population (C vs. G, OR, 1.245; 95% CI, 1.045-1.483; P=0.014; additive models: CC vs. GG, OR, 1.579; 95% CI, 1.100-2.265; P=0.013 and CG vs. GG, OR, 1.230; 95% CI, 1.039-1.456; P=0.016; dominant model, OR, 1.321; 95% CI, 1.127-1.549; P=0.001; recessive model, OR, 1.429; 95% CI, 1.017-2.009; P=0.040). Concerning GSTM1, a significantly increased NPC risk was observed in the overall population (null versus non-null, OR, 1.282; 95% CI, 1.075-1.530; P=0.006). In the subgroup analyses stratified by the source of controls, a significant association of p53 with NPC risk was also demonstrated, while no association with GSTM1 was observed. Therefore, the p53 G72C polymorphism may have a susceptible role in the carcinogenesis of NPC, while genetic deletion of GSTM1 may contribute to increased susceptibility to NPC. Further large and well-designed studies are required to confirm this association.']	('Wu', 'Muyun')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']
26893865	2016	12	Lessons from the past: Long-term safety and survival outcomes of a prematurely terminated randomized controlled trial on prophylactic vs. hemoglobin-based administration of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in patients with chemotherapy-induced anemia.	['Prophylactic erythropoiesis-stimulating agent (ESA) administration for chemotherapy-induced anemia (CIA) is not supported by current guidelines. Long-term follow-up of patients WHO had been treated with ESA for CIA in the past may provide useful information. In 2002, we undertook a prospective, randomized phase III trial of prophylactic vs. hemoglobin (Hb)-based (threshold: 11 mg/dl) ESA administration in patients with solid tumors and CIA. ESA administration FOR CIA was permanently suspended in 2007 in view of published data at that time, while patient surveillance continued. Among 630 evaluable patients, 38.6% were male, 50.9% had advanced cancer at diagnosis, 40.6% had Hb levels <12 mg/dl at baseline and 47.9% received ESA prophylactically (1:1 randomization). The major tumor types included colorectal (36.0%), breast (20.6%), non-prostate genitourinary (11.0%) and lung CANCER (8.4%). After a median follow-up of 85.4 months, 358 patients had relapsed and 380 had succumbed to the disease. Patients in the prophylactic ESA group (GROUP A; experimental arm), as compared with those in the Hb-based group (GROUP B; iron supplementation alone), exhibited A significantly more prominent increase in median Hb levels, particularly in the subset of patients with non-metastatic disease (two-sided P<0.01) among patients receiving chemotherapy for advanced cancer, those who received ESAs prophylactically exhibited a lower incidence of CIA (all grades: P=0.014, grades 3-4: P=0.034) and fatigue (all grades: P<0.001, grades 3-4: P=0.055), but a higher rate of a composite outcome encompassing all thrombosis-related events (all grades: P=0.043, grades 3-4: P=0.099). These differences were less prominent in the group of patients who received adjuvant treatment. There were no significant differences in overall mortality and relapse/progression rates between the two groups. therefore, prophylactic, compared with Hb-based, administration of ESAs for CIA in patients with solid tumors, was found to be associated with a significantly lower incidence of anemia and fatigue, but with a marginally higher rate of thrombosis-related adverse events, particularly in patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for advanced cancer.']	('Mountzios', 'Giannis')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

These tumors have been observed in the abdominal region, and are rarely encountered in the thoracic wall. The most effective treatment appears to be surgery. A 59-year-old female patient was admitted with the complaint of right breast pain and a palpable mass. The patient had undergone a modified radical mastectomy surgical procedure of the right breast due to invasive breast carcinoma 10 years before. A mass with a soft tissue density and a size of 44×22 mm was detected in the thoracic computed tomography of the patient, which subsequently resulted in biopsy followed by surgery. As a result of the pathological examination of the mass, the diagnosis was determined as desmoid tumor. Due to the closeness of the tumor to the surgical margin, the patient was administered radiotherapy and maintenance imatinib treatment was started.']	('De?irmencio?lu', 'Serkan')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

['Pulmonary adenocarcinoma (PA) with a micropapillary component (PA-MPC) is known as an aggressive subtype of PA. The molecular profiles of PA-MPC have not been well characterized. the pathological reports of patients who underwent surgical resection for lung cancer between April, 2004 and May, 2012 were reviewed. Of the 674 patients diagnosed with PA, 28 were found to have MPC. A total of 138 resected PAs without MPC were selected in the same period to serve as age-, gender- and smoking status-matched controls to the PA-MPC group. Mutational status was determined by the following two methods: SNaPshot assay based on multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), primer extension and capillary electrophoresis that was designed to assess 38 somatic mutations in 8 genes [AKT1, BRAF, endothelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1, neuroblastoma RAS viral oncogene homolog, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit ?

Regarding genetic alterations, 13 (46.4%) of the 28 PA-MPCs harbored mutually exclusive mutations: 9 (32.1%) EGFR mutations, 1 (3.6%) KRAS mutation and 3 (10.7%) EML4-ALK fusion genes. PAs without MPC harbored 42 (30.4%) EGFR mutations, 17 (12.3%) KRAS mutations, 3 (2.2%) EML4-ALK fusion genes and 1 (0.7%) PIK3CA mutation. EML4-ALK fusion genes appeared to occur significantly more frequently in PA-MPCs compared with PAs without MPC (P=0.027). Although the sample size was small, our study suggests that the molecular pathogenesis of PA-MPC may be different from that of other adenocarcinomas.']	('Furukawa', 'Masashi')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

['Percutaneous radiofrequency ablation (RFA) enables cauterization of liver cancer in a limited number of sessions without major complications. In contrast to the efficacy of this technique, the size of coagulation necrosis is limited due to increased impedance. D-sorbitol has been used as an irrigating fluid during transurethral resection of the prostate, since it is considered to be a dielectric fluid. In order to determine whether D-sorbitol enhances the effect of RFA, RFA was performed by slowly injecting 3% D-sorbitol near the tip of the RFA needle. The maximum of the total injected volume of D-sorbitol was 20 ml and RFA was terminated if the threshold of impedance was exceeded. RFA and D-sorbitol RFA were performed in 5 different parts of pig livers and dog livers in vivo. The total volumes of coagulation necrosis in the D-sorbitol RFA group were significantly higher compared with those in the RFA group. The total delivered energy in the D-sorbitol RFA group was also higher compared with that in the RFA group, due to the suppression of impedance elevation. No significant complications, such as bleeding or damage, were observed during the D-sorbitol RFA procedure in the in vivo model. In conclusion, RFA combined with D-sorbitol increases the total volume of coagulation necrosis through controlling impedance in the ablated liver and, therefore, D-sorbitol may be useful for the treatment of liver cancers.']	('Morishita', 'Asahiro')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether the diagnosis of ?4 LN metastases is possible using the OSNA assay intraoperatively. Between May, 2010 and December, 2014, a total of 134 patients who underwent axillary lymph node dissection (ALND) of positive SLNs were analyzed. The total tumor load (TTL) was defined as the total CK19 mRNA copies of all positive SLNs. The correlation between TTL and ?4 LN metastases was evaluated. Of the 134 patients, 31 (23.1%) had ?4 LN metastases. TTL ?5.4×104 copies/µl evaluated by receiver operator characteristic curve analysis was examined along with other clinicopathological variables. In the multivariate analysis, only TTL ?5.4×104 copies/µl was correlated with ?4 LN metastases (odds ratio = 2.95, 95% confidence interval: 1.17-7.97, P=0.022). Therefore, TTL assessed by the OSNA assay has the potential to be a predictor of ?4 LN metastases and it may be useful for the selection of patients with positive SLNs in whom ALND may be safely omitted.']	('Kubota', 'Michiyo')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

In the present study, immunohistochemistry was performed to investigate the protein expression of HEF1 in 123 hepatocellular carcinoma tissues and their adjacent normal liver tissues. Spearman's rank correlation, Kaplan-Meier plots and Cox regression model were used to analyze the data. Overexpression of HEF1 protein was observed in HCC tissue when compared with their adjacent non-malignant liver tissue. High expression of HEF1 correlated with higher advanced tumor, node, metastasis (TNM) stage and vascular invasion (P<0.05). In univariate and multivariate analysis, the expression of HEF1 was identified as an independent prognostic factor in the 123 patients with HCC. In subgroup analysis, high expression of HEF1 correlated with a poorer prognosis in advanced (TNM III+IV) stages (P<0.05).

The patient underwent thoracotomy for invasive thymoma 15 years previously, however, suffered a relapse in the left intrathoracic space. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy and partial resection, as secondary surgery for the intrathoracic mass, were performed. The histological findings in the resected specimens revealed type B3 thymoma. As the patient developed a left chest wall mass and pain in 2013, the mass was resected. The histological findings indicated two separate components composed of type B3 thymoma and squamous cell carcinoma. Immunohistological findings revealed that the thymoma cells were positive for CD5, while the thymic carcinoma cells were negative for CD5. Several reports have demonstrated the coexistence of thymic carcinoma and thymoma in the primary thymus, however, the development of a combined tumor in an extrathymic lesion is extremely rare. The present case had a long follow-up for recurrent thymoma. The present case indicated that the development and/or coexistence of malignant components in the thymoma must be taken into consideration for the treatment and/or management of patients with thymoma and that a pre-existence of CD5 expression in thymoma and the lost change may be associated with the process of malignant transformation.']	('Ohue', 'Yasuhiro')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

PubMed, Cochrane Library and the China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases were searched for all the published case-control studies on the association between MMP-2 expression and PCa until July 2015. The odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were used to estimate the association of MMP-2 expression and PCa. ORs and 95% CIs were applied to clarify this association. Several subgroup analyses were also conducted according to different indexes in the case group. In total, 8 studies including 675 patients were included in the final meta-analysis. The results of the meta-analysis showed that MMP-2 expression in the PCa group was significantly higher than that in the benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) group (95% CI, 0.06-0.15; Z=10.48; P<0.00001).

Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were calculated from the commencement of ipilimumab treatment. Associations between clinical characteristics and outcome or toxicity were assessed. Between 2008 and 2013, 129 patients with metastatic cutaneous melanoma were treated. Since, during this period, ipilimumab was approved in the second line setting, ipilimumab was delivered in the second or subsequent line in all patients, and 70% did not receive any further anticancer therapy. Immune-related toxicities were observed, the onset of which varied from 1 to 162 days.

['ErbB2 is known to upregulate glycolysis in breast cancer, however, the precise mechanisms remain unclear. In the present study, ErbB2 upregulated Hexokinase II (HK II) activity by increasing the binding of HK II to the mitochondrial outer membrane. Dysregulated glucose metabolism in high ErbB2-expressing breast cancer cells induces susceptibility to glucose starvation and glycolysis inhibition. Additionally, HK II has a tendency to dissociate from the mitochondria outer membrane in ErbB2-overexpressing cells following treatment with the HK II inhibitor, 3-BrPA. Furthermore, 3-BrPA treatment results in decreased mitochondria membrane potential and release of cytochrome c into cytoplasm in ErbB2-overexpressing cells, leading to activation of the mitochondrial apoptotic signaling pathway. In summary, the results demonstrate a novel mechanism for ErbB2-activated glycolysis and reveal that 3-BrPA is effective in reducing ErbB2-positive breast cancer cell viability by targeting HK II in vitro and in vivo.']	('Gao', 'Sujie')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

A comparison was made between those who responded well pathologically (good response group, Evans classification IIb/III) and those with a poor response (Evans I/IIa). NLR was determined to be significantly higher in the poor response group. Multivariate analysis identified an elevated NLR as an independent risk factor for the poor pathological response [odds ratio (OR), 5.35; P=0.0257]. The pre-treatment NLR (?2.2/<2.2) was found to be a statistically significant predictive indicator of pathological response (P=0.00699).

26893774	2016	12	The regulation of cancer cell migration by lung cancer cell-derived exosomes through TGF-? and IL-10.	['Tumorigenesis has been considered to be as a result of abnormal cell-cell communication. It has been proposed that exosomes act as communicators between tumors and their microenvironment and have been demonstrated to be involved in tumorigenesis and subsequent metastasis. However, the mechanisms underlying the role of exosomes in these processes remains elusive. The present study sought to determine the underlying mechanisms. Using two lung cancer cell lines, it was demonstrated that exosomes derived from metastatic small cell lung cancer cells (NCI-H1688) have greater effects on cancer cell migration, compared with exosomes derived from primary non-small cell lung cancer cells (NCI-H2228). Further characterization of the contents of the exosomes demonstrated that there were increased levels of TGF-? and IL-10 in exosomes from NCI-H1688 cells compared with exosomes derived from NCI-H2228 cells, in particular under hypoxia. Blockade of TGF-? and IL-10 with antibodies confirmed that these cytokines were essential for the regulation of cancer cell migration. Taken together, the results of the present study indicated that exosomes derived from cancer cells regulated the cellular migration of tumor cells through TGF-? and IL-10, which may provide a novel approach for developing therapeutic methods against cancer.']	('Wang', 'Yuzhou')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

"[""Reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) is a rare neurological syndrome of the brain, causing symptoms such as headaches, seizures, altered mental status and visual disturbances. The condition is predominantly associated with hypertension, eclampsia, renal impairment, cytotoxic drugs, immunosuppressive agents and molecular targeted agents, but the precise underlying mechanism of RPLS is not fully understood. The present study describes the case of a 65-year-old female patient with stage IIA non-small cell lung cancer who received cisplatin/pemetrexed treatment at the Leo W. Jenkins Cancer Center. Following 3 cycles of this therapy, the patient was referred to the Emergency Department of Vidant Medical Center with an altered mental status, subsequently presenting with epileptic seizures, a fever and a headache. A neurological examination revealed generalized hyperreflexia and paraparesis, with extensor posturing of the bilateral lower extremities. The lumbar puncture and electroencephalography results were normal, but cranial computed tomography (CT) scans revealed attenuation abnormalities in the bilateral parietal region and the left occipital lobe, with suspected metastasis. Cranial T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) indicated bilateral regions of increased signal intensity in the occipital, temporal and periventricular white matter. The patient was treated with anticonvulsants, steroids and antihypertensive drugs, recovered gradually from the symptoms and regained full consciousness. However, the patient reported residual weakness, presenting with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score of 3, reflective of an inability to independently perform daily activities and self-care. A brain MRI performed 10 days later demonstrated that the subcortical edema had partially subsided. The patient was discharged on day 15 post-admission. A follow-up cranial CT examination 1 month later indicated a partial resolution of the abnormalities. The present report reviews similar associated cases, and also discusses the clinical features and mechanisms underlying RPLS. Although it is typically reversible, RPLS is a serious and potentially life-threatening adverse condition if left untreated. Early recognition of this condition is crucial for the prompt control of the patient's blood pressure or withdrawal of cytotoxic drugs in order to reverse this syndrome.""]"	('Xie', 'Changqing')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893768	2016	12	Curcumin mediates reversion of HGF-induced epithelial-mesenchymal transition via inhibition of c-Met expression in DU145 cells.	['The hepatocyte growth factor (HGF)/c-Met signaling pathway results in cancer cell scattering and invasion, and has been reported to participate in several types of cancer, including prostate and colorectal cancer. The downstream phosphorylation cascade of HGF, particularly the mitogen-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/AKT signaling pathway, regulates epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, the mechanism by which these signaling pathways govern EMT, and whether certain kinases are able to respond to specific EMT effectors, remains to be elucidated. In the present study, an increase in the levels of vimentin, rather than co-regulation of certain EMT marker proteins, was observed in response to HGF-induced EMT in DU145 prostate cancer cells. In addition, it was observed that curcumin abrogated HGF-induced DU145 cell scattering and invasion. Furthermore, curcumin was able to effectively inhibit the HGF-induced increase in the levels of vimentin by downregulating the expression of phosphorylated c-Met, extracellular signal-regulated kinase and Snail. In conclusion, the results of the present study demonstrated that curcumin was able to reverse HGF-induced EMT, possibly by inhibiting c-Met expression in DU145 prostate cancer cells.']	('Hu', 'Hui-Jun')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Myeloproliferative neoplasms are associated with lymphoproliferative diseases following the administration of cytotoxic drugs or exposure to radiation, but are rare prior to therapy. The present study reports the case of a 61-year-old female with a history of transient ischemic attack. The patient, who presented with a palpable mass in the epitrochlear area of the left arm, was simultaneously diagnosed with follicular lymphoma and an unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasm. Excisional lymph node biopsy revealed stage I follicular lymphoma (grade 1). Laboratory findings demonstrated leukocytosis, erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis and decreased erythropoietin. Biopsy of the bone marrow revealed hypercellularity, with predominance of erythroid cells, and large polylobated megakaryocytes with increased mitotic figures, but no evidence of lymphomatous infiltration. The janus kinase 2 V617F mutation was also detected in the cells derived from the bone marrow specimen. Following local excision of the lymph node in the left epitrochlear area, radiation was delivered to the involved field, at a dose of 24 Gy in 12 fractions. The patient was started on hydroxyurea (1 g twice per day, orally) 2 weeks subsequent to radiotherapy, and was administered 500 mg twice per day as maintenance therapy. At the six-month follow-up, the white blood cell count, hemoglobin levels and platelet count had reduced, and the patient was in a healthy condition. A computed tomography scan of the neck, chest and abdomen indicated no abnormalities. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is the first case report of follicular lymphoma coexisting with an unclassifiable myeloproliferative neoplasm in a previously healthy patient. Molecular and genetic studies are required to further evaluate this infrequent disease association.']	('Jeong', 'Gyeongmin')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Xanthogranuloma of the stomach is a rare disease, and to the best of our knowledge, only a few cases have been reported to date. The present patient was a 64-year-old man who underwent a wide resection of the stomach following a Billroth-I reconstruction for a gastric ulcer ~40 years prior to the current presentation. Due to tarry stools, a gastrointestinal endoscopy was performed, leading to identification of an ulcerated gastric lesion located at the previous suture line at the lesser curvature of the remnant stomach. This lesion was elevated, appearing to indicate a submucosal tumor. Positron emission tomography revealed uptake of fluorodeoxyglucose radiotracer by the tumor. Although not indicated by the biopsy specimens, a malignant tumor of the remnant stomach was suspected, in the form of a malignant gastrointestinal tumor or remnant gastric cancer. Curative resection of the tumor was successfully performed. Histological examination of the resected specimens revealed xanthogranulomatous inflammation consisting of foamy histiocytes and plasma cells, however, no cancer cells were observed. The tumor was diagnosed as xanthogranulomatous gastritis that mimicked a malignant tumor of the remnant stomach. The present study therefore indicates that inflammatory tumors should be considered in the differential diagnosis of malignant tumors.']	('Okamura', 'Akihiko')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893757	2016	12	Expression levels of SOX2, KLF4 and brachyury transcription factors are associated with metastasis and poor prognosis in oral squamous cell carcinoma.	['The prognosis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) patients is affected by tumor recurrence and metastasis, and cancer stem cells are hypothesized to be involved in these processes. Thus, the aim of the present study was to determine whether the expression levels of five stem cell-related transcription factors, sex determining region Y-box 2 (SOX2), octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct4), avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (c-Myc), Krüppel-like factor 4 (KLF4) and brachyury, are associated with metastasis and survival in OSCC. Immunohistochemistry was performed to analyze the expression of these proteins in biopsy specimens obtained from 108 OSCC patients. The results revealed that the expression of SOX2, Oct4, KLF4 and brachyury were significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (P=0.002, P=0.031, P=0.003 and P=0.007, respectively). In addition, the expression of KLF4 and brachyury were significantly associated with distant metastasis (P=0.014 and P=0.012, respectively). Furthermore, multivariate analysis revealed that SOX2 and KLF4 are predictive factors for lymph node metastasis [odds ratios (ORs), 4.526 and 4.851, respectively], and KLF4 is also a predictive factor for distant metastasis (OR, 9.607). In addition, OSCC patients with low co-expression of SOX2, KLF4 and brachyury exhibited a significantly lower disease-specific survival rate (78.6 vs. 100%; P=0.025; ?2=5.033) and disease-free survival rate (60.7 vs. 90.9%; P=0.015; ?2=5.897) when compared with OSCC patients with high co-expression of these factors. The results indicate that SOX2, KLF4 and brachyury serve important roles in tumor progression, and these transcription factors may thus represent clinically useful prognostic markers for OSCC.']	('Yoshihama', 'Rumi')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Lung cancer is a malignancy with the highest incidence of morbidity and mortality worldwide. The lack of effective detection methods leads to the ineffectiveness of convetional therapy. The aim of the current study was to analyze the hydrothorax epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation in patients with advanced non-small lung cancer (NSCLC) and malignant pleural effusion. A new method for clinical treatment was developed through a comparison of the difference of EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-targeted therapy. Between January 2013 and January 2015, 68 cases diagnosed with advanced non-small lung cancer and malignant pleural effusion, were enrolled in the study. Previous first-line chemotherapeutic treatment schemes had been unsuccessful. EGFR 19 and EGFR 21 sites were detected for all the patients. Platinum-based drugs were provided for patients with wild-type EGFR. These patients served as the control group and underwent four cycles of treatments, with each cycle lasting 3 weeks. TKI medicine Gefitinib (Iressa) was administered to patients with mutant EGFR tid, po, for a duration of 4-8 months. These patients served as the experimental group. There were 41 cases of EGFR mutations, of which 13 cases had EGFR 19 site mutations, 16 cases EGFR 21 site mutations, and the remaining 12 cases had 2 site mutations. EGFR mutations were not significant for gender, age, tumor type, stage and diameter (P>0.05). The results showed that the six-month survival rate, progression-free survival time (PFS), objective response rate (RP) and disease control rate (DCR) in the experimental group were higher than those in the control group. The drug side-effects in the experimental group indicated no statistical differences compared to the control group (P>0.05). The incidence of EGFR mutation was higher in patients with advanced non-small lung cancer and malignant pleural effusion. Targeted therapy improved the survival rate and was deemed to be a safe and effective method for patients with EGFR mutations.']	('Zhou', 'B O')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893751	2016	12	Expression profiling of selected microRNA signatures in plasma and tissues of Saudi colorectal cancer patients by qPCR.	['MicroRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) have been advocated as potentially robust and highly stable biomarkers of diverse disease conditions including cancer. The primary aim of this study was two-fold: i) to profile the expression levels of selected mature miRNA signature genes, such as miR-145, miR-195, miR-29 and miR-92, in a paired-study design of 20 colorectal cancer (CRC) tissues from patients versus adjacent neoplasm-free mucosal tissues employing reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction; and ii) to examine their expression level in the plasma of the same CRC patients in relation to the age-matched plasma of healthy controls. Statistically significant (P<0.01) increases in miR-29 (2.5) and miR-92 (2.6) were observed in CRC tissues compared with adjacent neoplasm-free mucosal tissues. Profiling of CRC plasma samples showed that the expression levels of circulating miR-29 and miR-92 were significantly higher (P<0.01) than in the age-matched normal plasma. By contrast, miR-145 and miR-195 exhibited significant (P<0.05) decreases in their mean expression levels in CRC tissue samples in relation to the normal tissues. The mean expression levels of miR-145 and miR-195 were significantly lower (P<0.05) in CRC plasma than the healthy controls. Distinct stage-dependent changes in the expression level of the four miRNA gene profiles were observed between stages II and IV plasma of CRC patients relative to the control plasma. Taken together, the results clearly reflect a similar trend for the four miRNA expression levels in tissue and plasma as well as the positive correlation in the levels of miRNAs in tissues and plasma. These findings may be useful to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying colorectal carcinogenesis and to underscore the potential of the investigated miRNAs as novel early diagnostic biomarkers of CRC.']	('Al-Sheikh', 'Yazeed A')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Radical cystectomy, as the most common surgical treatment for patients with invasive bladder cancer (IBC) complicated by peritoneal metastasis, is usually accompanied by a urinary diversion procedure. In this study, we evaluated the improved tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy technique by comparing the resulting clinical effects with either a traditional ureterostomy and an ileal conduit urinary diversion. Clinical data from 85 patients who underwent 1 of the 3 procedures between April 2012 and April 2015 were analyzed retrospectively. In total, 30 patients underwent improved tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy, 28 patients underwent a traditional cutaneous ureterostomy and 27 underwent an ileal conduit urinary diversion following radical cystectomy. The incidence of complications, including stoma infection, nipple atrophy, terminal necrosis, urine leakage, external orifice stenosis, uronephrosis and ureterectasia in the group of patients treated with the improved tubeless ureterostomy technique was significantly lower than that of the patients in the other 2 groups, and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.05). In addition, the duration of the surgery, intra-operative bleeding, the duration of the hospitalization period and the time to extubation in the patients treated with the improved tubeless ureterostomy technique were significantly decreased (P<0.05) compared with the patients in the other 2 groups. Finally, the health-related quality of life of the patients treated with the improved tubeless ureterostomy technique was significantly higher (P<0.05) than that of the patients in the other 2 groups. The findings of our study demonstrated that the use of the improved tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy technique following radical cystectomy in patients with IBC complicated by peritoneal metastasis resulted in improved clinical effects. Thus, improved tubeless cutaneous ureterostomy may be a promising alternative for enhancing the quality of life of patients with IBC.']	('Liu', 'Zan')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['This study aimed to explore the underlying genes and pathways associated with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) by bioinformatics analyses. Gene expression profile GSE43795 was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between six PDAC and five non-neoplastic pancreatic tissue samples were analyzed using the limma package. Gene ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analyses of DEGs were performed, followed by functional annotation and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction. Finally, the sub-network was identified and pathway enrichment analysis was performed on the contained DEGs. A total of 374 downregulated and 559 upregulated DEGs were identified. The downregulated DEGs were enriched in GO terms associated with digestion and transport and pathways related to metabolism, while the upregulated DEGs were enriched in GO terms associated with the cell cycle and mitosis and pathways associated with the occurrence of cancer including the cell cycle pathway. Following functional annotation, the oncogene pituitary tumor-transforming 1 (PTTG1) was upregulated. In the PPI network and sub-network, cell division cycle 20 (CDC20) and BUB1 mitotic checkpoint serine/threonine kinase B (BUB1B) were hub genes with high connectivity degrees. Additionally, DEGs in the sub-network including cyclin B1 (CCNB1) were mainly enriched in the cell cycle and p53 signaling pathways. In conclusion, the cell cycle and p53 signaling pathways may play significant roles in PDAC, and DEGs including CDC20, BUB1B, CCNB1 and PTTG1 may be potential targets for PDAC diagnosis and treatment.']	('Long', 'Jin')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Gene Ontology (GO) and pathway enrichment analysis of DEGs were performed, followed by functional annotation and construction of a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network. Subnetwork modules were subsequently identified and analyzed. A total of 181 DEGs, including 95 upregulated and 86 downregulated DEGs, were identified, in addition to 20 GO biological processes terms enriched by upregulated DEGs and 14 enriched by downregulated DEGs. The upregulated DEGs were enriched in 18 pathways, and the downregulated DEGs were enriched in 7 pathways. Following functional annotation, three upregulated transcription factors (TFs), including hypoxia inducible factor 1, alpha subunit (HIF1A), and six downregulated TFs were identified. In the PPI network and subnetwork, matrix metallopeptidase 1 (MMP1), also known as interstitial collagenase, and interleukin 8 (IL8) were the hub genes with the highest degree of connectivity (degree =8). Integrin alpha (ITGA)6 and 2 were enriched in several pathways, including focal adhesion and extracellular matrix-receptor interaction. DEGs of SCC were primarily enriched in pathways associated with cancer and cell adhesion.

26893746	2016	12	High RhoA expression at the tumor front in clinically localized prostate cancer and association with poor tumor differentiation.	['Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA) has been reported as essential to the invasion process and aggressiveness of numerous cancers. However, there are only sparse data on the expression and activity of RhoA in clinically localised prostate cancer. In numerous cancers, tumour cells at the invasive front demonstrate more aggressive behaviour in comparison with the cells in the central regions. In the present study, the expression and activity of RhoA was evaluated in 34 paraffin-embedded and 20 frozen prostate tissue specimens obtained from 45 patients treated with radical prostatectomy for clinically localised cancer. The expression patterns of RhoA were assessed by immunohistochemical staining and western blotting. Additional comparisons were performed between the tumour centre, tumour front and distant peritumoural tissue. RhoA activity was assessed by G-LISA. Associations between RhoA expression and the clinical features and outcome of the patients were also analysed. The present study found an increasing gradient of expression from the centre to the periphery of index tumour foci. RhoA expression was significantly increased at the tumour front compared to the tumour centre, which was determined using immunohistochemistry (P=0.001). Increased RhoA expression was associated with poor tumour differentiation in the tumour front (P=0.044) and tumour centre (P=0.039). Subsequent to a median follow-up period of 52 months, the rate of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) relapse was increased in patients with higher RhoA expression at the tumour front when compared with patients with lower RhoA expression (62.5 vs. 35.0%), although the difference was not significant (P=0.09). There was no association between RhoA expression and the PSA level or pathological stage in the present study. In conclusion, RhoA expression was increased at the tumour front and was associated with poor tumour differentiation in the tumour front and tumour centre, indicating the potential role of RhoA in prostate cancer. RhoA expression may also act as a prognostic factor in prostate cancer. The present data provide a foundation for novel therapeutic approaches by targeting RhoA in prostate cancer.']	('Chen', 'Weihua')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893742	2016	12	Evaluation of the cytotoxic effects of Cyperus longus extract, fractions and its essential oil on the PC3 and MCF7 cancer cell lines.	['Cyperus longus is one of the Iranian endemic species. However, to date, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no availale academic reports on the cytotoxicity of this plant. Thus, this study was carried out to examine the in vitro anti-proliferative and anti-apoptotic effects of Cyperus longus extract, fractions and essential oil (EO) on MCF7 and PC3 cell lines. The chemical constituents of EO were identified using gas chromatography (GC)-mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. The cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 medium and incubated with various concentrations of the plant extract and fractions. Cell viability was quantified by MTT assay following 24, 48 and 72 h of exposure to (12.5-200 µg/ml) of the methanol extract, the dichloromethane (CH2Cl2), ethyl acetate (EtOAc) and water fractions, as well as the EO of the plant. The percentage of apoptotic cells was determined using propidium iodide staining of DNA fragments by flow cytometry (sub-G1 peak). The most effective fraction in the MCF7 cell line was the CH2Cl2 fraction (IC50 after 48 h, 25.34±2.01). The EtOAc fraction (IC50 after 48 h, 35.2±2.69) and the methanol extract (IC50 after 48 h, 64.64±1.64) were also found to be effective. The IC50 values obtained for the PC3 cell line were 37.97±3.87, 51.57±3.87 and 70.33±2.36 for the CH2Cl2 fraction, the EtOAc fraction and the methanol extract, respectively. Based on these data and due to the partial polarity of the most effective fraction (the CH2Cl2 fraction), we also examined the cytotoxicity of the plant EO. The IC50 values after 48 h were 22.25±4.25 and 12.55±3.65 in the PC3 and MCF7 cell lines, respectively. DNA fragmentation assay also confirmed these data. Performing GC-MS analysis for the plant EO revealed that ?-himachalene (10.81%), ?-caryophyllene oxide (7.6%), irisone (4.78%), ?-caryophyllene oxide (4.36%), humulene oxide (12%), viridiflorol (4.73%), aristolone (6.39%) and longiverbenone (6.04%) were the main constituents.

['The incidence of gastric cancer coupled with multiple bone metastases, and/or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), is characterized by the clinical presentation of rapid progression and a poor prognosis, and differs from typical gastric cancers. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are negligible in typical advanced gastric cancers, however, a considerable number of CTCs in the bloodstream may be detected in the subgroup demonstrating multiple bone metastases and/or DIC. The present study analyzed two cases, with the first case regarding a 51-year-old male who exhibited a CTC count of 275 cells/7.5 ml following an initial, ineffective, chemotherapy cycle. The patient underwent a second chemotherapy course that was effective, and the cell count was observed to reduced to 2 cells/7.5 ml. A decreased CTC count was first confirmed on day 16 following treatment. During the chemoresistant phase, the CTC count was observed to increase again. The second case presented by the current study describes a 59-year-old female who exhibited a CTC count of 235 cells/7.5 ml prior to chemotherapy. This subsequently decreased to 7 cells/7.5 ml following an effective course of chemotherapy. Notably, the CTC count increased alongside disease progression in this case. Within the rare subgroup of gastric cancer patients with multiple bone metastases and/or DIC, CTC count may serve as an early biomarker allowing the evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. However, due to the aggressive nature of this type of cancer, imaging analysis is not recommended as it may typically take several months to complete.']	('Inoue', 'Masahiro')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Scorpion venom contains various types of proteins and peptides that are able to act as inhibitors of neurotransmitter molecules. This is achieved primarily via the inhibition of ion channels. In addition, scorpion venom has been demonstrated to exhibit anticancer properties in prostate and breast cancer, as well as leukemia. The anticancer properties of scorpion venom are due to its inhibitory effect on matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity, which leads to reduced motility and invasion in tumor cells. The inhibitory effects of venom on MMPs additionally lead to a reduction in the metastatic potential of malignant tumors. In the present study, the effect of venom obtained from a local serpentarium facility was examined in colorectal and breast cancer cell lines. Cell motility and clonogenic survival assays revealed a significant decrease (60-90%) in cell motility and colony formation, two significant hallmarks of cancer survival, following treatment with various concentrations of venom. These results were in agreement with previous studies demonstrating the anticancer activity of scorpion venom. In conclusion, the venom utilized at the Research Center of Prince Sultan Military Medical City Hospital (Riyadh, Saudi Arabia) possesses significant anticancer potential against colorectal and breast cancer cell lines.']	('Al-Asmari', 'Abdulrahman Khazim')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Thus, in the present study, the recombinant lentiviral (Lv) small hairpin (sh)RNA expression plasmids Lv/sh-Stat3 and Lv/sh-ADAM9, which targeted Stat3 and ADAM9, respectively, were constructed and subsequently infected into the A549 human NSCLC cell line. Cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis were determined in vitro in A549 cells following treatment with Lv/sh-Stat3 or Lv/sh-ADAM9 alone or in combination. In addition, the combined effect of Lv/sh-Stat3 and Lv/sh-ADAM9 gene therapy was evaluated in vivo using A549 xenograft models in nude mice. The in vitro experiments demonstrated that A549 cells treated with a combination of Lv/sh-Stat3 and Lv/sh-ADAM9 exhibited a significant additive effect in their cell proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis abilities, compared with A549 cells treated with Lv/sh-Stat3 or Lv/sh-ADAM9 alone. The in vivo experiments conducted in A549 xenograft tumor mouse models revealed that the combined treatment with Lv/sh-Stat3 and Lv/sh-ADAM9 exerted an additive effect on tumor growth inhibition, compared with the treatment with Lv/sh-Stat3 or Lv/sh-ADAM9 alone.

['MicroRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) serve an important role in the regulation of carcinogenic pathways. RCC is the most prevalent kidney cancer that occurs in adults. miRNAs have gained increasing attention due to their association with RCC tumorigenesis, serving as biomarkers for early detection and progression monitoring, and as potential targets for molecular therapy. Upregulation of miRNA-142-3p has been previously identified in RCC tissues by microarray profile, however, its expression and function in RCC have not yet been validated. In the present study, quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed to quantify the relative expression of miR-142-3p in 53 paired RCC and adjacent normal tissues. Furthermore, wound healing, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide and flow cytometry assays were performed to analyze the impacts of miR-142-3p on cellular migration, proliferation and apoptosis. The results demonstrated that miR-142-3p was significantly upregulated in RCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. Downregulation of miR-142-3p, induced by chemically synthesized miR-142-3p inhibitor, significantly suppressed cell migration and proliferation, and promoted cell apoptosis in 786-O and ACHN cells, supporting the theory that miR-142-3p may function as an oncogene in RCC. The potential clinical significance of miR-142-3p, as a biomarker and therapeutic target, provides rationale for further investigation into the miR-142-3p-mediated molecular pathway and how it is associated with RCC development.']	('Li', 'Yifan')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Patients with cancer were examined through the use of lumbar magnetic resonance imaging, and clinical data was collected between September and December, 2012, at Jilin Province Tumor Hospital (Changchun, China). The data was subsequently compared between patients with and without sarcopenia. Of the 113 treated cancer patients, 96 patients [39 males (L3 index, <52.4 cm2/m2) and 57 females (L3 index, <38.5 cm2/m2)] suffered from sarcopenia. Overall, the development of sarcopenia was not significantly associated with patient age or treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy (P>0.05). The frequency of treatment-associated complications did not differ significantly between patients with or without sarcopenia. However, males were more inclined to develop sarcopenia than females (P=0.02). Patients with sarcopenia had significantly less lymphocytes than patients without sarcopenia (P=0.03). This was confirmed through multiple logistic regression analyses (P=0.046), which also identified that patients with cancer with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group score >2 had a significantly increased risk of developing sarcopenia. Finally, the serum albumin level in sarcopenia patients was 36.18±4.65 g/l, which was not significantly less than that of patients without sarcopenia (39.67±3.69 g/l; P=0.11). The incidence of sarcopenia among patients with cancer is high, particularly for males. Further research with larger sample sizes would be beneficial, with the aim of verifying the results obtained in the present study. During the treatment of patients with sarcopenia, precaution should continue to be taken to prevent associated complications, including infection, diarrhea and myelosuppression.']	('Zhang', 'Guoxing')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893723	2016	12	Association between the expression levels of TAZ, AXL and CTGF and clinicopathological parameters in patients with colon cancer.	['Colon cancer accounts for a large proportion of all the cancer-associated morbidities worldwide. Genetic analysis and stratification of patients based on survival may identify genetic signatures potentially useful for prognostic or treatment planning purposes. Previous studies have reported that the messenger (m)RNA expression levels of tafazzin (TAZ), AXL receptor tyrosine kinase (AXL) and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) were able to predict the survival of patients with colon cancer in two independent colon cancer datasets. However, limited clinicopathological data were available from these two datasets. By contrast, a large colon cancer dataset comprising 566 patients has been recently published in the Gene Expression Omnibus database, which contains data regarding tumor stage and location, and genetic status of mismatch repair (MMR), Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS), B-Raf proto-oncogene serine/threonine kinase (BRAF) and tumor protein p53 (TP53). In the present study, the mRNA expression levels of TAZ, AXL and CTGF were evaluated, and the TAZ-AXL-CTGF signature was correlated with the available pathological parameters and survival data. Overexpression of TAZ, AXL and CTGF was observed to be associated with severe pathological stage, deficiency in MMR, colon cancer subtype C4 and mutations in the BRAF gene. In addition, overexpression of TAZ-AXL-CTGF was associated with short overall survival in patients with mutations in the TP53 gene, colon cancer subtype C6, proficient MMR and wild-type status of the KRAS and BRAF genes. Furthermore, the prognostic value of TAZ-AXL-CTGF overexpression was observed to be independent of all the clinicopathological parameters and mutational statuses analyzed. The results of the present study confirm the previously reported findings, and suggest that the TAZ-AXL-CTGF mRNA signature is a potential prognostic indicator in colon cancer.']	('Zhang', 'Shu-Dong')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893721	2016	12	Coexistence of adenomyosis and endometrioid endometrial cancer: Role in surgical guidance and prognosis estimation.	"[""The aim of the current study was to diagnose the concomitant presence of adenomyosis (AM) in endometrioid endometrial cancer (EEC) in order to evaluate its value as an oncological prognostic marker. A retrospective analysis of 289 patients diagnosed with EEC who underwent total hysterectomy, bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy and pelvic-lymphadenectomy was conducted. The total cohort included 37 patients in Group A (those with concomitant AM and EEC) and 252 patients in Group B (those affected only by EEC). The following factors were evaluated: Presence or absence of AM, tumor grade, depth of myometrial invasion, tumor size, lymphovascular space involvement, lymph node status, peritoneal cytology, concomitant detection of endometrial atypical-hyperplasia or polypoid endometrial features and tumor stage according to the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) classification. Uterine examination of different sections of uterine cervix, corpus, myomas and cervical or endometrial polyps was performed. The diagnosis of AM was confirmed when the distance between the lower border of the endometrium and the foci of the endometrial glands and stroma was >2.5 mm. Parametric and nonparametric statistical tests were performed when possible; continuous variables were analyzed using a Student's t-test, and categorical variables were analyzed by the ?2 test or Fisher's exact test. The association between FIGO stage and group was determined to be significant: 83.8% of Group A patients were categorized as FIGO stage I, vs. 68.7% of Group B patients. In addition, Group A was associated with lower grades in FIGO stage, myometrial invasion, lymphovascular space involvement, lymph node involvement and tumor size. The findings suggest that the intraoperative evaluation of the presence of AM in patients with EEC may aid surgeons in estimating oncological risk and in selecting the most appropriate surgical treatment.""]"	('Gizzo', 'Salvatore')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893720	2016	12	MicroRNA-126 inhibits the migration and invasion of endometrial cancer cells by targeting insulin receptor substrate 1.	['MicroRNAs (miRs) have been demonstrated to serve important roles in the development and progression of human cancer, primarily through the direct targeting of oncogenes or tumor suppressors. It has been previously suggested that miR-126 may be associated with endometrial cancer (EC). However, the exact role of miR-126 in the migration and invasion of EC cells has not yet been studied. The present study demonstrated that the expression of miR-126 was significantly decreased in EC tissues when compared with matched normal adjacent tissues. The current study reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed in order to examine the expression level of miR-126. Wound healing and transwell assays were used to examine cell migration and invasion. A luciferase reporter assay was used to determine the targeting relationship and western blotting assay was performed to detect the protein expression. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-126 significantly inhibited EC SKOV3 cell migration and invasion. Molecular mechanism investigation established that insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS1) functioned as a direct miR-126 target, and its expression was negatively regulated by miR-126 at a post-transcriptional level in the SKOV3 cells. Additionally, the overexpression of IRS1 reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-126 overexpression on SKOV3 cell migration and invasion. In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that miR-126 inhibited EC cell migration and invasion, at least partially through the direct targeting of IRS1, suggesting that miR-126 may aid the treatment of EC metastasis.']	('Zhao', 'Xiumin')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893719	2016	12	Increased oncogenic microRNA-18a expression in the peripheral blood of patients with prostate cancer: A potential novel non-invasive biomarker.	['MicroRNAs have been demonstrated to be stably detectable in peripheral blood, thus representing important sources of non-invasive biomarkers of various diseases, including cancer. Recently, microRNA-18a (miR-18a) has been revealed to be highly expressed in prostate cancer (PC) tissues, acting as an oncogenic miRNA. The present study evaluated miR-18a expression in the peripheral blood of patients with PC, patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and healthy individuals, to assess the feasibility of using peripheral blood miR-18a as a potential non-invasive biomarker for PC. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral whole blood samples from 24 PC patients, 24 BPH patients and 23 healthy control individuals. The expression of miR-18a was assessed by reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The results revealed that miR-18a expression was significantly higher in PC patients than in BPH patients and healthy controls [fold change (mean ± standard deviation), 5.5±1.4 for PC, 1.5±0.5 for BPH and 1.2±0.6 for controls; P<0.005]. Higher miR-18a expression was strongly associated with PC [odds ratio (OR), 4.602; 95% confidence interval (CI), 2.194-9.654; P=0.001], but was not significantly associated with BPH (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 0.7-2.02; P=0.332). Despite the small number of patients, which limits the statistical power of the study, higher miR-18a expression was observed to be significantly correlated with certain clinicopathological parameters, including Gleason score >7 and pathological tumor stage 3/4 (P<0.005). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that miR-18a discriminated PC patients from BPH patients and healthy controls [area under the curve (AUC), 0.805; 95% CI, 0.704-0.906). Furthermore, use of the ROC curve to discriminate PC from BPH patients yielded an AUC of 0.878 (95% CI, 0.783-0.972). In summary, the present results indicate that miR-18a expression is significantly increased in peripheral blood of patients with PC compared with that of BPH patients and healthy individuals, and that higher miR-18a expression is associated with progression of PC. Peripheral blood oncogenic miR-18a may serve as a potential novel non-invasive biomarker for PC that also facilitates discrimination between PC and BPH.']	('Al-Kafaji', 'Ghada')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893717	2016	12	Downregulation of BC200 in ovarian cancer contributes to cancer cell proliferation and chemoresistance to carboplatin.	['Previous studies have demonstrated that long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) serve an important role in carcinogenesis. BC200 is a lncRNA that is reportedly associated with ovarian cancer. The aim of the present study was to investigate this potential association between BC200 and ovarian cancer, and to subsequently analyze the biological function of BC200 in the disease. BC200 expression was compared in ovarian cancer tissue and normal ovarian tissue samples through the use of quantitative polymerase chain reaction. To allow the biological function of BC200 in ovarian cancer to be analyzed, small interfering RNA was used to knock down the expression of BC200 in SKOV3 and A2780 ovarian cancer cells. The proliferative, invasive and migratory abilities of the cells were identified by means of cell counting kits and Transwell assays. Carboplatin was also used to treat the ovarian cancer cells, and a luminescent cell viability assay was subsequently used to detect the sensitivity of the cells to the carboplatin. The results demonstrated that BC200 expression was reduced in ovarian cancer compared with normal ovarian tissue samples. In the SKOV3 and A2780 cells, BC200 exerted no effect on invasive or migratory ability, however, the inhibition of BC200 was demonstrated to promote cell proliferation. Additionally, it was observed that carboplatin induced BC200 expression in the cell lines, and that the inhibition of BC200 decreased the sensitivity of the cells to the drug. BC200 is therefore likely to have a tumor suppressive function in ovarian cancer by affecting cell proliferation. Furthermore, BC200 appears to serve a role in the mediation of carboplatin-induced ovarian cancer cell death.']	('Wu', 'D I')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Previous studies have produced inconsistent results regarding the contribution of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene to ovarian cancer (OC) in various ethnicities. Additionally, little has been established with regard to the role of SNPs located in the retinoid X receptor ? (RXRA), vitamin D-binding protein [also know as group-specific component (GC)] and VDR genes in non-carriers of the breast cancer 1/2 early onset (BRCA1/BRCA2) gene mutations. All participating individuals in the present study were evaluated for BRCA1 mutations (5382incC, C61G and 4153delA) with HybProbe assays, and for BRCA2 mutation (5946delT) using high-resolution melting (HRM) analysis. The associations of 8 SNPs located in RXRA, GC and VDR were investigated in OC patients without the BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations (n=245) and healthy controls (n=465). Genotyping of RXRA rs10881578 and rs10776909, and GC rs1155563 and rs2298849 SNPs was conducted by HRM analysis, while RXRA rs749759, GC rs7041, VDR BsmI rs1544410 and FokI rs2228570 genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. In addition, the gene-gene interactions among all tested SNPs were studied using the epistasis option in PLINK software. The lowest P-values of the trend test were identified for VDR rs1544410 and GC rs2298849 as Ptrend=0.012 and Ptrend=0.029, respectively. It was also found that, in the dominant inheritance model, VDR BsmI contributed to an increased risk of OC [odds ratio (OR), 1.570; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.136-2.171; P=0.006; Pcorr=0.048]. The gene-gene interaction analysis indicated a significant interaction between RXRA rs749759 and VDR FokI rs2228570 (OR for interaction, 1.687; ?2=8.278; asymptotic P-value=0.004; Pcorr=0.032). In conclusion, this study demonstrated that certain VDR and RXRA SNPs may be risk factors for OC in non-carriers of BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations in the Polish population.']	('Mostowska', 'Adrianna')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

The expression of Sirt1 was detected by the immunohistochemical streptavidin peroxidase detection method in paraffin-embedded sections, whilst Sirt1 protein expression was examined by western blot analysis in the fresh tissues. Sirt1 protein was primarily expressed in the nuclei of the tumor cells, and positive staining was brownish-yellow in color. The relative expression quantities of Sirt1 in the peritumoral normal rectal mucosa and rectal carcinoma were 1.15 and 2.62, and the differences between the two groups were statistically significant (P<0.05). The expression level of Sirt1 in colorectal carcinoma was significantly associated with the depth of tumor invasion, differentiation and tumor size (P<0.05).

26893712	2016	12	Effect of miR-155 knockdown on the reversal of doxorubicin resistance in human lung cancer A549/dox cells.	['Doxorubicin has been widely used in the treatment of cancer. However, acquired doxorubicin resistance severely hinders the application of the drug. In the present study, doxorubicin resistance was investigated in lung carcinoma. microRNA-155 (miR-155) was found to be upregulated in the doxorubicin-resistant A549/dox cell line. Suppression of miR-155 in this cell line considerably reversed doxorubicin resistance, and doxorubicin-induced apoptosis and cell cycle arrest were recovered. Furthermore, reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis revealed that miR-155 suppression downregulated the expression of multidrug resistance protein 1, multidrug resistance-associated protein 1, breast cancer resistance protein, glutathione S-transferase-?, Survivin and B-cell lymphoma 2, and upregulated the expression of caspase-3 and caspase-8. In addition, it was found that miR-155 suppression inhibited the activation of AKT and extracellular signal-regulated kinase. The transcriptional activity of nuclear factor-?B and activator protein-1 was also downregulated. In summary, the present results indicate that miR-155 may participate in doxorubicin resistance in lung carcinoma.

['An increasing number of studies have indicated that the deregulation of microRNAs (miRNAs) contributes to tumorigenesis and metastasis. In the present study, significant upregulation of miR-362-5p was identified in the breast cancer MDA-MB-231 and MCF7 cell lines compared with the control CCD-1095Sk cell line. The inhibition of miR-362-5p was demonstrated to significantly inhibit the cell proliferation, migration and invasion of human breast cancer MCF7 cells. In addition, the knockdown of miR-362-5p induced G1 arrest and promoted apoptosis in the breast cancer cells. Mechanistic investigations confirmed that the tumor suppressor gene CYLD is a direct target of miR-362-5p. The ectopic expression of miR-362-5p represses CYLD expression, whereas miR-362-5p inhibitor treatment induces CYLD protein expression and decreases NF-?B expression in the downstream signaling pathway. Thus, these findings may provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms through which miR-362-5p regulates breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. This study also suggests that miR-362-5p may act as a novel potential therapeutic target for the treatment of breast cancer.']	('Ni', 'Fang')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['The present study aimed to investigate the effects of Na+/H+ exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF1) gene knockdown, using short-hairpin RNA (shRNA), on the malignant behaviors of prostate cancer cells. A pSuper.puro NHERF1 shRNA vector was transfected into PC-3M prostate cancer cells using Lipofectamine 2000. Stable cell lines were obtained and NHERF1 knockdown was verified through western blot analysis. MTT assays were then used to measure PC-3M cell proliferation; in addition, cell migration was assessed using a wound healing assay. Flow cytometry was employed in order to determine the effects of NHERF1 knockdown on apoptosis. Expression levels of apoptotic pathway proteins B cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein were then determined by western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that shRNA knockdown of NHERF1 significantly suppressed the proliferation of PC-3M cells by >50%. In addition, knockdown of NHERF1 significantly inhibited the migration of PC-3M cells. PC-3M cells harboring NHERF1 shRNA exhibited significantly increased apoptosis, with an ~4-fold increase compared with that of the parental PC-3M cells and cells transfected with an empty vector. Furthermore, the results revealed that knockdown of NHERF1 reduced the protein expression of Bcl-2, although the expression of Bax was unaltered. In conclusion, NHERF1 knockdown using shRNA inhibited the proliferation and migration of PC-3M cells and promoted apoptosis, highlighting the role of NHERF1 in prostate cancer progression.']	('Ma', 'Qiang')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Salvage radiotherapy for post-prostatectomy biochemical recurrence does not always control the disease. It would be useful to identify patients who would not benefit from radiotherapy to the prostate bed prior to making treatment recommendations. One such group of patients is those who experience continuously rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) despite radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to identify risk factors for continuous PSA increase and the pattern of radiological relapse during follow-up. We performed a retrospective comparison of two patient groups with PSA decline or continuous increase following salvage radiotherapy to the prostate bed. All patients received 3-D conformal radiotherapy (35 fractions of 2 Gy). Patients with continuous PSA increase were more likely to have had complete surgical resection (negative margins) and a shorter interval to radiotherapy (<24 months). However, the only statistically significant risk factor was Gleason score. Sixty-four percent of patients with a Gleason score of 9 developed continuously increasing PSA, indicating that residual subclinical cancer was not located in the prostate bed. The median time to radiological recurrence was 43 months. Isolated pelvic nodal recurrence was uncommon. Almost all patients with radiological recurrence had high-risk disease, in particular stage pT3. In conclusion, the majority of patients with biologically aggressive tumors with Gleason score 9 were not adequately treated with prostate bed radiotherapy alone. The predominant pattern of radiological recurrence was outside of the pelvis. Therefore, the problem of distant micrometastases has to be addressed.']	('Nieder', 'Carsten')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

In the present study, the expression and clinical effect of S100A14 was evaluated in serous ovarian carcinoma (SOC). SOC tissue specimens and a panel of normal ovarian and fallopian tubal tissue specimens were obtained between November 2008 and August 2012 from the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao University. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to detect the expression of S100A14 in the SOC and normal control tissues. In addition, ELISA was performed to assess S100A14 expression in a subset of serum samples. The association between the expression of S100A14 in SOC and the corresponding clinical and pathological data was analyzed. The IHC results revealed that S100A14 was mainly located in the cytoplasm of the majority of SOC cells, and the expression levels of S100A14 in the tumor tissues were significantly increased compared with the levels identified in normal ovarian specimens (P<0.001). Consistently, the serum levels of S100A14 in patients with SOC were also increased compared with the levels in healthy individuals (P<0.001). S100A14 expression was similar in the epithelium of SOC lesions and the fallopian tube, which supported the dualistic model for ovarian serous carcinogenesis. Additional analysis of the expression of S100A14 and corresponding clinical and pathological data revealed the correlation between the elevated expression of S100A14 and resistance to platinum-based chemotherapy. However, the protein level of S100A14 was not associated with the pathological stage, differentiation or metastasis of SOC.

['Pancreatic cancer is one of the most lethal types of malignant solid tumor and is typically associated with a poor prognosis. The majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease, therefore, the median survival period is <6 months. Recently, a number of basic research projects and clinical trials were undertaken with the aim of improving treatment outcomes in pancreatic cancer; however, only one agent, erlotinib, passed the clinical trials. Erlotinib is an inhibitor of epidermal growth factor receptor, which when overexpressed in cancer, promotes angiogenesis, cell proliferation and inhibits apoptosis. The US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency approved erlotinib in combination with gemcitabine for the first-line treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to report a case of pancreatic cancer treated with this regimen alone to achieve a complete response (CR). A 40-year-old male with a medical history of chronic pancreatitis and hypertension was diagnosed with medically inoperable adenocarcinoma of the pancreas. Following palliative surgery, the patient began palliative gemcitabine and erlotinib chemotherapy. After three months, this treatment strategy resulted in a CR, as determined by imaging studies. Therapy was discontinued after 14 months due to the development of peritoneal metastases and the patient was referred for treatment with the folinic acid, 5-fluorouracil, irinotecan and oxaliplatin regimen.

Therefore, the present study investigated miR-497 expression in HCC samples and HCC-derived cell lines using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein expression of one of the predicted common targets of miR-497, insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF-1R), was assessed using western blot analyses and immunohistochemistry. The role of miR-497 in regulating the proliferation of HCC-derived cells was also investigated in vitro and in vivo. Of 60 paired specimens from HCC patients, miR-497 was downregulated in 42 cancer specimens compared with adjacent non-cancer tissues. Western blotting and immunohistochemical analyses revealed that IGF-1R expression was significantly increased in HCC compared to control tissues. In addition, overexpression of miR-497 was observed to inhibit colony formation and tumor growth in MHCC-97H human HCC cells. Conversely, SMMC-7721 human HCC cells transfected with a miR-497 inhibitor exhibited enhanced colony formation and tumor growth. Finally, IGF-1R protein, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt signaling pathway-associated proteins and cyclin pathway-associated proteins were differentially expressed between miR-497-overexpressing cells and miR-497-silenced cells.

The current study reports a rare case of HAS, characterized by gastric cancer and infiltration of cancer cells into the left liver lobe, as well as lymphadenectasis. The expression of ?-fetoprotein (AFP) was markedly increased in the tumor cells of the liver neoplasms. A gastric biopsy indicated highly, moderately and poorly differentiated papillary adenocarcinoma. The patient underwent two cycles of chemotherapy with oxaliplatin (130 mg; day 1) and capecitabine (2 mg, twice daily; days 1-14). At 7 weeks after the chemotherapy, an expanded gastrectomy and radical resection of left lung lobe were performed on the operable lesion. AFP expression was significantly decreased following the procedure. A literature review was also conducted by searching PubMed/Medline, indicating that surgery and chemotherapy may positively affect the outcomes of HAS patients.']	('Shen', 'Zhihong')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893693	2016	12	Complete response of giant desmoplastic small round cell tumor treated with chemoradiotherapy: A case report.	['Desmoplastic small round cell tumor (DSRCT) is a rare tumor that mainly affects adolescents, and typically involves the abdominal and pelvic peritoneum. The present study reports one case of giant DSRCT, treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy, and reviews the available medical literature. A 38-year-old man presented with a 3-month history of pain in the left lower abdomen and nausea, associated with decreased appetite and weight loss. Computed tomography (CT) showed a 12.3×7.9 cm confluent solid mass in the lower abdomen and pelvic cavity. The patient underwent exploratory laparotomy and the final pathological diagnosis was DSRCT. Following laparotomy, the patient was treated with external beam radiotherapy to the whole abdomen and pelvis to a dose of 40 Gy plus a 20 Gy boost to the residual disease. The results indicated that synchronous chemotherapy with cyclophosphamide, adriamycin and cisplatin combined with radiotherapy significantly improved locoregional control of DSRCT and a complete response, as measured by CT assessment 2 months subsequent to radiotherapy. In conclusion, DSRCT is a rare malignancy requiring multidisciplinary treatment, including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The results of the present study confirm that radiotherapy has a significant role in the treatment of advanced abdominal DSRCT and may contribute to durable remission.']	('Zhang', 'Shuo')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893688	2016	12	Interleukin-8: A potent promoter of angiogenesis in gastric cancer.	['Angiogenesis is a critical process in the development of tumor malignancy and occurs at various stages of tumor progression. Interleukin-8 (IL-8) is a pro-angiogenic factor produced by tumor-infiltrating macrophages that has been revealed to facilitate the development of angiogenesis in various cancers. However, whether IL-8 activates angiogenesis in gastric cancer remains unclear. The present study investigated the effect of IL-8 on the migration and canalization capacities of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). In addition, the protein and messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of selected angiogenesis markers, consisting of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, VEGF receptor (VEGFR)-1 and VEGFR-2, were assessed in the HUVECs. The HUVECs were co-cultured with human gastric cancer SGC7901 cells and exposed to various concentrations of IL-8 (0, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 ng/ml). The migration and canalization abilities of the cells were detected by Transwell chamber and tube formation assays. Protein expression was detected using immunofluorescence and western blot analysis, and mRNA levels were assessed using reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The protein and mRNA levels of VEGF-A, VEGFR-1 and VEGFR-2 were measured in HUVECs cultured for 24 h. IL-8 at concentrations of 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 ng/ml significantly promoted HUVEC cell migration (P=0.005, P=0.001 and P<0.001, respectively) and tube formation (P=0.039, P=0.003 and P<0.001, respectively). IL-8 at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 ng/ml significantly elevated the protein levels of VEGF-A (P<0.001) and VEGFR-2 (P=0.034, P<0.001, P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). IL-8 at concentrations of 0.8 and 1.0 ng/ml significantly elevated the protein levels of VEGF-1 (P=0.037 and P=0.002, respectively). Similarly, IL-8 at concentrations of 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 ng/ml significantly upregulated the mRNA levels of VEGF-A (P=0.046, P=0.001 and P<0.001, respectively) and VEGFR-1 (P=0.042, P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). IL-8 at concentrations of 0.2, 0.5, 0.8 and 1.0 ng/ml significantly upregulated the mRNA levels of VEGFR-2 (P=0.003, P=0.005, P<0.001 and P<0.001, respectively). In conclusion, IL-8 may be a potent promoter of angiogenesis in gastric cancer.']	('Shi', 'Jun')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893687	2016	12	Didymin reverses phthalate ester-associated breast cancer aggravation in the breast cancer tumor microenvironment.	['The present study demonstrated two novel findings. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first study to demonstrate that regulated upon activation, normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), produced by breast tumor-associated monocyte-derived dendritic cells (TADCs) following breast cancer cell exposure to phthalate esters, may contribute to the progression of cancer via enhancement of cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Furthermore, the present study revealed that didymin, a dietary flavonoid glycoside present in citrus fruits, was able to reverse phthalate ester-mediated breast cancer aggravation. MDA-MB-231 cells were treated with butyl benzyl phthalate (BBP), di-n-butyl phthalate (DBP) or di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP). Subsequently, the conditioned medium (CM) was harvested and cultured with monocyte-derived dendritic cells (mdDCs). Cultures of MDA-MB-231 cells with the conditioned medium of BBP-, DBP- or DEHP-MDA-MB-231 tumor-associated mdDCs (BBP-, DBP- or DEHP-MDA-TADC-CM) demonstrated enhanced proliferation, migration and invasion. Exposure of the MDA-MB-231 cells to DBP induced the MDA-TADCs to produce the inflammatory cytokine RANTES, which subsequently induced MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, migration and invasion. Depleting RANTES reversed the effects of DBP-MDA-TADC-mediated MDA-MB-231 cell proliferation, migration and invasion. In addition, didymin was observed to suppress phthalate-mediated breast cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion. The present study suggested that didymin was capable of preventing phthalate ester-associated cancer aggravation.']	('Hsu', 'Ya-Ling')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893686	2016	12	Regulation and clinical significance of the hypoxia-induced expression of ANGPTL4 in gastric cancer.	['Solid tumors are often exposed to hypoxia. Hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1? upregulates numerous target genes associated with the malignant behavior of hypoxic cancer cells. A member of the angiopoietin family, angiopoietin-like protein 4 (ANGPTL4) is a hypoxia-inducible gene. The present study aimed to clarify whether ANGPTL4 is regulated by HIF-1? in gastric cancer cells. The study also assessed whether ANGPTL4 expression is associated with clinicopathological factors or HIF-1? expression in gastric cancer tissues. Hypoxia-induced ANGPTL4 expression was quantitatively analyzed using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) in 10 gastric cancer cell lines. RT-qPCR was further employed to investigate the HIF-1? dependency of ANGPTL4 expression using HIF-1?-knockdown transfectant 58As9-KD and control 58As9-SC gastric cancer cells. The HIF-1? and ANGPTL4 expression levels were immunohistochemically analyzed in 170 gastric cancer tissue specimens and were assessed for any correlations with the clinicopathological factors and/or patient survival. Subsequently, hypoxia-induced ANGPTL4 expression was observed in 7 out of 10 gastric cancer cell lines. The hypoxic induction of ANGPTL4 was almost preserved in the 58As9-KD cells compared with that observed in the 58As9-SC cells, while the induction of known HIF-1? target gene, carbonic anhydrase 9, was completely suppressed in the 58As9-KD cells. In the gastric cancer tissues, ANGPTL4 expression was inversely correlated with the tumor depth, whereas HIF-1? expression was positively correlated with venous invasion. A survival analysis revealed that the expression of ANGPTL4 was significantly correlated with a longer survival time, whereas that of HIF-1? was correlated with a shorter survival time. In conclusion, the present findings indicate that hypoxia-induced ANGPTL4 expression is independent of HIF-1? in hypoxic gastric cancer cells. ANGPTL4 may be a favorable marker for predicting a long survival time, whereas HIF-1? predicts a poor prognosis, in gastric cancer patients. The hypoxic environment independently induces ANGPTL4 and HIF-1?, which are believed to exhibit adverse effects on tumor progression.']	('Kubo', 'Hiroshi')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893685	2016	12	Correlation between the overexpression of Yin Yang 1 and the expression levels of miRNAs in Burkitt's lymphoma: A computational study.	"[""A growing number of studies have highlighted the role of microRNAs (miRNAs or miRs) in the development and progression of cancer. In particular, the aberrant expression of cancer-related proteins, such as oncogenes and tumor suppressors has been shown to correlate with the modulation of the expression of specific miRNAs. In the present study, we aimed to determine which downregulated miRNAs may be involved in modulating the expression of the oncogenic transcription factor, Yin Yang 1 (YY1). YY1 has been reported to be overexpressed in several malignancies and our previous studies have highlighted the significant correlation between the levels of YY1 and aggressive behavior in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). A total of 57 miRNAs that are potentially capable of targeting YY1 was identified through in silico approaches. The search of publicly available NHL datasets, including paired mRNA and miRNA data (GSE23026) highlighted a significant correlation (Pearson's correlation, r>0.5) between the expression levels of YY1 and the expression levels of a limited set of miRNAs, including miR-363, miR-200a, miR-23b, miR-15a and miR-15b. Intriguingly, both hsa-miR-363 and hsa-miR-200a belong to the top 20 miRNAs that were found to be downregulated in Burkitt's lymphoma (BL) tissue compared to normal tissue. Although further validation studies are warranted, the identification of these two miRNAs associated with the upregulation of YY1 in BL may provide further insight into the pathogenesis of this tumor and may contribute to more personalized and targeted treatment approaches for patients with this disease.""]"	('Hafsi', 'Sameh')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Myoferlin is a protein that is associated with cellular repair following injury. The expression of myoferlin in breast cancer and pancreatic adenocarcinoma has been reported to correlate with tumor invasiveness, epithelial to mesenchymal transition and an adverse prognosis. In the present study, myoferlin expression was investigated in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), along with its association with patient prognosis and the expression of a number of other proteins. A total of 148 patients exhibiting NSCLC were enrolled in the present study. The survival data of all patients was examined, and myoferlin, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), epidermal growth factor receptor, E-cadherin, ?-catenin, thyroid transcription factor-1 and tumor protein p63 expression was investigated via immunohistochemical staining of tissue microarrays. Myoferlin expression was detected in the cytoplasm of 75/148 (50.7%) of the NSCLC cases. In the adenocarcinoma cases, myoferlin-positive patients possessed a poorer prognosis (odds ratio, 2.94; P=0.339). In the squamous cell carcinoma cases, myoferlin expression was significantly associated with VEGFR-2 expression (P=0.001). Immunohistochemical staining for VEGFR-2 and myoferlin expression indicated similar features and cytoplasmic staining in tumor cells. As VEGFR-2 is a significant target for novel anticancer therapies, it is anticipated that myoferlin may also possess the potential to become a novel clinical target for the treatment of NSCLC.']	('Song', 'Dae Hyun')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Investigation of the mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies is essential as resistance acquired during treatment may lead to relapse or refractoriness to the therapy. Our previous study identified the small molecule KRC-108 as a result of efforts to find an anticancer agent with c-Met-inhibitory activity. In the present study, the changes accompanying resistance to KRC-108 were investigated in the gastric cancer cell line MKN-45 and its KRC-108-resistant clones by western blot and immunofluorescence analyses. Increased expression of the c-Met protein was observed in KRC-108-resistant cells compared with that of the parental cells, and the phosphorylation of c-Met also increased in cell lines resistant to KRC-108. Resistance to the c-Met inhibitor was associated with cell morphological changes: MKN-45 parental cells, which had a round and poorly differentiated morphology, were altered to exhibit an epithelial cell-like phenotype in KRC-108-resistant clones. Consistent with the transition to an epithelial morphology, the expression of E-cadherin was increased in resistant cells. Using immunoprecipitation, an interaction between E-cadherin and the c-Met protein was observed in the KRC-108-resistant cells. Immunohistochemical analysis of human gastric carcinoma tissues revealed the co-expression of E-cadherin and c-Met. These results suggest that the epithelial transition in KRC-108-resistant cells is mediated by recruiting E-cadherin to c-Met protein. Thus, the present study identified a mechanism used by cancer cells to confer resistance to anticancer agents.']	('Kim', 'Dong Chul')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

A total of 108 NSCLC patients (stages I-IIIA) were treated with a standard chemotherapy regimen of cisplatin plus vinorelbine. Additionally, in vitro cultured A549 cells were treated with cisplatin in the presence or absence of tunicamycin. Cell proliferation was determined by MTT assay and protein levels were assessed via western blot analysis. Patients with BAG1-positive expression were revealed to have a prolonged survival time (progression-free survival, 24.0 months) compared with that of patients without BAG1 expression (21.6 months; ?2=18.018, P<0.05). Treatment of A549 cells with tunicamycin followed by cisplatin resulted in elevated BAG1 levels. In addition, tunicamycin was found to significantly enhance cisplatin-induced growth inhibition and apoptosis in A549 cells. The results indicate that BAG1 is important in cisplatin-induced cell death in lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting that endoplasmic reticulum stress may promote the sensitivity of NSCLC patients to chemotherapy.']	('Wang', 'Yadi')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Focal adhesion kinase (FAK) expression has been identified as associated with cancer development and metastasis. Autophosphorylation of FAK at tyrosine (Y) 397 (pY397) performs a critical role in tumor cell signaling. However, few studies have evaluated the expression of pY397 FAK in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In the present study, pY397 FAK expression in NSCLC was investigated using immunohistochemistry. pY397 FAK staining scores were compared between various groups of specimens and the associations between clinical and pathological characteristics were investigated. A Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to determine the association between pY397 FAK expression and the prognosis of NSCLC patients. The results of the present study revealed that pY397 FAK expression was localized to the cytoplasm of lung cells, and that pY397 FAK was overexpressed in NSCLC tissues, as well as associated metastatic tissues, when compared with the corresponding non-tumor tissues. However, no significant difference was identified between the pY397 FAK expression in primary lesions and lymph node metastases. Furthermore, pY397 FAK staining scores were not found to be associated with the tumor size, gender, degree of differentiation, histotypes, presence of lymph node metastases or survival rate of NSCLC patients. These results indicate that pY397 FAK is involved with the development of NSCLC, but is not a prognostic marker for the disease.']	('Wang', 'Baichun')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893678	2016	12	Study on chemotherapeutic sensitizing effect of nimotuzumab on different human esophageal squamous carcinoma cells.	['Esophageal cancer is one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. Although, surgery, radio- and chemotherapy are used to treat the disease, the identification of new drugs is crucial to increase the curative effect. The aim of the present study was to examine the chemotherapeutic sensitizing effect of nimotuzumab (h-R3) and cisplatin cytotoxic drugs cisplatin (DDP) and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) on esophageal carcinoma cells with two different epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) expressions. The expression of EGFR was detected in the human EC1 or EC9706 esophageal squamous cell carcinoma cell line using immunohistochemistry. The inhibitory effect of DDP and 5-FU alone or combined with h-R3 on EC1 or EC9706 cell proliferation was detected using an MTT assay. Flow cytometry and the TUNEL assay were used to determine the effect of single or combined drug treatment on cell apoptosis. The results showed that the expression of EGFR was low in EC1 cells but high in EC9706 cells. The inhibitory effect of the single use of h-R3 on EC1 or EC9706 cell proliferation was decreased. The inhibitory effect between single use of h-R3 alone and combined use of the chemotherapy drugs showed no statistically significant difference (P>0.05) on the EC1 cell growth rate, but showed a statistically significant difference (a=0.05) on EC9706 cell growth rate. The results detected by flow cytometry and TUNEL assay showed that the difference between single use of h-R3 alone and the control group was statistically significant with regard to the EC1 apoptosis rate effect (P<0.05), but not statistically significant for EC9706 (P>0.05). However, statistically significant differences were identified in the apoptotic rate of EC9706 cells between the h-R3 combined chemotherapy group and single chemotherapy group (P<0.05), but not on in the EC1 chemotherapy group (P>0.05). In conclusion, the sensitization effect of h-R3 on chemotherapy drugs is associated with the expression level of EGFR in EC1 or EC9706 cells. The cell killing effect of the combined use of h-R3 with DDP and 5-FU showed no obvious synergistic effect compared to the single-drug group, but only an additive effect.']	('Yang', 'Xiaoyu')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893676	2016	12	Assessment of radioiodine therapy efficacy for treatment of differentiated thyroid cancer patients with pulmonary metastasis undetected by chest computed tomography.	['Radioiodine therapy (RAI) has proven effective for the treatment of patients exhibiting differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC) with pulmonary metastases. However, the early detection of metastasis remains challenging, and various studies have reported variations in radioiodine treatment efficacy. The present study investigated whether RAI is an effective method for the treatment of DTC with pulmonary metastases undetected by computed tomography (CT). A retrospective study was performed, analyzing iodine-131 (131I) therapy in 21 DTC patients with lung metastases that were undetected by CT. All 21 patients were initially treated with radioiodine ablation of thyroid remnants. Routine chest CT was performed prior to 131I treatment without diagnostic radioiodine whole-body scanning (DxWBS), and post-therapeutic WBS was performed 3-5 days subsequent to oral administration of 131I. The overall effectiveness rate was 95.2% (20/21). The rates for complete response (CR), partial response and no response were 23.8 (5/21), 71.4 (15/21) and 4.8% (1/21), respectively. There were 12 patients with diffuse uptake, and the remaining 9 patients demonstrated focused and low uptake. The difference in CR rate between diffuse uptake and focused uptake patients was not statistically significant (P=0.123). A correlation was observed between thyroglobulin (Tg) levels and extrapulmonary metastases. All patients exhibited extrapulmonary metastases when Tg levels were >87.5 ng/ml (area under receiver operating characteristic curve, 1.0; P<0.001). Overall, DTC patients with lung metastases undetected by CT imaging responded well to 131I radiotherapy and demonstrated a positive prognosis. Serum Tg levels prior to 131I treatment may correlate with metastasis, and this may suggest a requirement for the performance of DxWBS prior to radiotherapy.']	('Long', 'Bin')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Fifteen patients exhibiting stage IB-IIA high-risk cervical cancer, who had been treated with postoperative adjuvant concurrent radiochemotherapy, were selected. The clinical target volume (CTV) and organs at risk (OARs) were delineated according to contrast computed tomography images. The planning target volume (PTV) was subsequently produced by using 1 cm uniform expansion of the CTV. The treatment plans were intended to deliver 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The OARs that were contoured included the bladder, rectum, small bowel and femoral heads. Dose volume histograms were used to evaluate the dose distribution in the PTV and OARs. VMAT and f-IMRT treatment plans resulted in similar dose coverage of the PTV. VMAT was superior to f-IMRT in conformity (P<0.05), and resulted in a reduction of OARs irradiated at high dose levels (V40 and V50) compared with f-IMRT (P<0.05), particularly for the bladder. However, the doses of low levels (V10 and V20) delivered to OARs with f-IMRT were slightly reduced compared with VMAT (P<0.05). For ambilateral femoral heads, VMAT demonstrated improved sparing compared with f-IMRT, with regard to D5 (P<0.05). Furthermore, VMAT treatment plans revealed a significant reduction in monitor units (MU) and treatment time. VMAT techniques exhibited similar PTV coverage compared with f-IMRT. At doses of high levels delivered to OARs, VMAT demonstrated improved sparing compared with f-IMRT, particularly for the bladder, while significantly reducing treatment time and MU number.']	('Qiao', 'Lili')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Despite clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK) being the second most common renal tumor in children, its mechanism has not yet been fully investigated. The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential role of vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) in CCSK development. Following preprocessing of the original GSE2712 data, the differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between 14 CCSK and 3 fetal kidney samples were identified through Significance Analysis of Microarrays, using the R package. Pathway enrichment analysis was then performed on the DEGs. A protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins database and the DEGs that were enriched in the most significant pathways. Following this, gene ontology analysis was performed on the VEGFA-associated genes, whilst transcription factor binding site analysis was conducted on the hot genes. A total of 2,681 DEGs, including 543 upregulated and 2,138 downregulated genes, were identified, and these were significantly enriched in pathways associated with cancer and focal adhesion. Furthermore, VEGFA, integrin ?1, integrin ?V, v-akt murine thymoma viral oncogene homolog 1 and endothelial growth factor receptor were identified as hot genes in the PPI network. In addition, the upregulated VEGFA-associated genes, cyclin D1 and cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B, affected kinase regulation, and the downregulated VEGFA-associated genes, receptor tyrosine-protein kinase erbB-2, mesenchymal-epithelial transition tyrosine kinase receptor and kinase insert domain receptor, were enriched in the protein tyrosine kinase process. It was identified that VEGFA was regulated by restorer of fertility, erythromycin resistance methylase, GA binding protein subunit ?, norepinephrine transporter, nuclear factor ?B and Sp2 transcription factor genes. Overall, VEGFA and its associated genes serve important roles during CCSK development, and alongside transcription factors, they may function as novel therapeutic targets for disease treatment.']	('Wang', 'Zhikui')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26893673	2016	12	miR-96 induces cisplatin chemoresistance in non-small cell lung cancer cells by downregulating SAMD9.	"[""Cisplatin is effective as a single agent or in combination with other drugs for the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A concerning clinical challenge with cisplatin-based NSCLC chemotherapy is the intrinsic and acquired chemoresistance to cisplatin. The sterile ? motif domain-containing (SAMD9) gene has been reported as a potent tumor suppressor gene that inhibits tumorigenesis and progression of NSCLC. microRNAs (miRNA) have been revealed to play important roles in the regulation of cancer chemoresistance. To the best of our knowledge the present study explored the role of miRNA/SAMD9 signaling in regulating cisplatin chemoresistance in NSCLC for the first time. Out of the several candidate miRNAs predicted to bind the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of the SAMD9 gene, miRNA-96 (miR-96) demonstrated significant target-sequence-specific inhibition of the SAMD9 3'-UTR luciferase reporter activity in NSCLC cells. In addition, while NSCLC tumor samples exhibited significantly higher expression levels of miR-96 compared with adjacent normal tissues, the expression levels of SAMD9 were significantly lower than those in adjacent normal tissues. miR-96 and SAMD9 were overexpressed and knocked down in the human NSCLC H358 and H23 cell lines and the half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) of cisplatin and cell apoptosis rate under cisplatin treatment were used as measures of cisplatin chemoresistance. The present results identified that overexpression of miR-96 in NSCLC cells markedly decreased SAMD9 expression and cisplatin-induced apoptosis, and increased the cisplatin IC50, which could be eliminated by overexpression of SAMD9. By contrast, knocking down miR-96 in NSCLC cells using antagomir-96 significantly increased SAMD9 expression and the cisplatin-induced apoptosis and decreased cisplatin IC50, which could be completely reversed by a knockdown of SAMD9. In conclusion, the current study demonstrates that miR-96 targets and downregulates SAMD9 in NSCLC, which decreases cisplatin-induced apoptosis and induces cisplatin chemoresistance in NSCLC cells. The findings of the present study add novel insights into the function of miR-96 and SAMD9 in cancer, as well as into the molecular mechanisms underlying NSCLC chemoresistance.""]"	('Wu', 'Lin')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Interleukin-6 (IL-6) expression in local tumor tissues is associated with cancer progression and poor prognosis in variety of cancer types. The aim of the present study was to investigate the role and potential application of IL-6 in determining the prognosis of esophageal carcinoma. KYSE170 and TE13 esophageal cancer cell lines were used to conduct cell- and animal-based experiments investigating biological changes and tumor behavior. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that 70-80% of cancer cells exhibited positive staining for IL-6, compared with <15% of non-malignant epithelial cells. These immunohistochemical results were consistent with the mRNA expression levels detetced. The IL-6 silencing vector significantly reduced invasion and proliferation of the two cell lines and attenuated tumor growth in xenograft mouse models (P<0.05). The IL-6 silencing vector markedly reduced the presence of Ki-67 (a typical proliferation marker) and microvessel density, indicating that downregulation of IL-6 levels may greatly affect tumor growth and inhibition. The IL-6 silencing vector increased E-cadherin and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9 expression levels in the two esophageal carcinoma cell lines. This vector also regulated the release of IL-6 in cell supernatant and serum in KYSE170- and TE13-tumor-bearing mice. The secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor and cluster of differentiation 31 (a nuclear protein) immunoreactive molecules were also reduced by the IL-6 silencing vector. Therefore, IL-6 may be an important trigger in the progression of angiogenesis and endothelial tube formation within the tumor, and targeting IL-6 may be a promising strategy for the treatment of esophageal cancer.']	('Zhao', 'Zhi-Fei')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

In addition, overexpression of anti-apoptotic protein B-cell lymphoma (Bcl)-2 have been demonstrated in various cancer cells and is closely associated with drug resistance and poor prognosis. Naringenin is a flavonoid that has antimutagenic and anticarcinogenic activities in numerous cancer types. In the present study, naringenin and a Bcl-2 inhibitor, ABT-737, were used to investigate their combinative anticancer effect in the SGC7901 gastric cancer cell line. The results revealed that naringenin and ABT-737 were able to inhibit SGC7901 cell growth and colony formation, alone or in combination. Furthermore, the combination of these drugs was found to further increase the cleavage of caspase-3 and poly ADP-ribose polymerase. Naringenin and ABT-737 also decreased Akt activation and increased p53 expression, suggesting the involvement of these pathways in the inhibition of gastric cell growth.']	('Zhang', 'Haiyang')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']
26893657	2016	12	Upregulation of microRNA-375 increases the cisplatin-sensitivity of human gastric cancer cells by regulating ERBB2.	['Resistance to chemotherapy is a major challenge in the effective treatment of patients with gastric cancer; however, the mechanisms underlying chemoresistance in gastric cancer cells are yet to be elucidated. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have previously been associated with cancer progression and sensitivity to chemotherapy; therefore, the present study aimed to identify miRNAs that may influence the sensitivity of human gastric cancer cells to cisplatin (DDP) treatment. Initially, miRNAs that were differentially expressed between the DDP-sensitive SGC7901 human gastric cancer cell line and DDP-resistant SGC7901/DDP cell line were identified using high-throughput sequencing technology. miRNA-375 (miR-375), which was shown to be downregulated in the SGC7901/DDP cells, has previously been associated with numerous types of cancer; however, to the best of our knowledge, a role for miR-375 in the DDP-sensitivity of gastric cancer cells has yet to be explored. In the present study, the expression levels of miR-375 were significantly downregulated in the SGC7901/DDP cells, as compared with the SGC7901 cells, as demonstrated by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In addition, upregulation of miR-375 significantly enhanced the anti-proliferative and apoptosis-inducing effects of DDP, whereas downregulation of miR-375 decreased these effects. Subsequently, western blot analysis demonstrated that upregulation of miR-375 in the SGC7901/DDP cells increased their sensitivity to DDP treatment via regulating the protein expression levels of erb-b2 receptor tyrosine kinase 2 and phosphorylated-Akt. The results of the present study indicate that the expression levels of miR-375 may influence the sensitivity of human gastric cancer cells to the effects of DDP; thus suggesting that a combination of miR-375 regulation and DDP may be considered a novel strategy in the treatment of patients with chemoresistant gastric cancer.']	('Zhou', 'Ning')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']

['Fangchinoline (Fan) is a bioactive compound isolated from the Chinese herb Stephania tetrandra S. Moore (Fen Fang Ji). The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of Fan on the proliferation of SPC-A-1 lung cancer cells, and to define the associated molecular mechanisms. Following treatment with Fan, Cell Counting Kit-8, phase contrast imaging and Giemsa staining assays were used to detect cell viability; flow cytometry was performed to analyze the cell cycle distribution; and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot assays were used to investigate changes in the expression levels of cell cycle-associated genes and proteins. In the present study, treatment with Fan markedly inhibited the proliferation of SPC-A-1 lung cancer cells and significantly increased the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle in a dose-dependent manner (P<0.05 for 2.5-5 µm; P<0.01 for 10 µm), whereas the percentage of cells in the S and G2/M phases were significantly reduced following treatment (P<0.05 for 5 µm; P<0.01 for 10 µm). Mechanistically, Fan significantly reduced the mRNA expression levels of cyclin D1, cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) and CDK6 (P<0.05 for 2.5-5 µm; P<0.01 for 10 µm), which are key genes in the regulation of the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle. Furthermore, treatment with Fan also decreased the expression of phosphorylated retinoblastoma (Rb) and E2F transcription factor-1 (E2F-1) proteins (P<0.05 for 5 µm; P<0.01 for 10 µm). In summary, the present study demonstrated that Fan inhibited the proliferation of SPC-A-1 lung cancer cells and induced cell cycle arrest at the G0/G1 phase. These effects may be mediated by the downregulation of cellular CDK4, CDK6 and cyclin D1 levels, thus leading to hypophosphorylation of Rb and subsequent suppression of E2F-1 activity. Therefore, the present results suggest that Fan may be a potential drug candidate for the prevention of lung cancer.']	('Luo', 'Xue')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']

['Insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) is an effective survival factor that is involved in the development and progression of various tumors. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether baseline serum IGF-1 levels are associated with time to progression (TTP) and overall survival (OS) in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) who have undergone transarterial chemoembolization (TACE). A total of 145 patients with HCC who underwent TACE as an initial treatment were enrolled in the study. Baseline serum IGF-1 levels were detected using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. The patients were followed up for a median follow-up period of 47 months (range, 10.6-69.3 months). During the follow-up, 98 patients (76.6%) experienced disease progression and 59 patients (46.1%) succumbed. The serum IGF-1 level was found to be significantly associated with hepatitis infection status, Child-Pugh class, bilirubin level, tumor size and nodularity, vascular invasion and the Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage. Multivariate analysis was conducted, which indicated that BCLC stage, vascular invasion and serum IGF-1 were independent risk factors for disease progression. When clinical factors were examined as potential independent risk factors for OS, only advanced BCLC stage and low serum IGF-1 levels were found to be significantly associated with poorer OS. These results suggest that serum IGF-1 may serve as a predictor of the prognosis of patients with HCC undergoing TACE.']	('Liu', 'Sheng')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']

The mRNA expression levels of CD133, (sex determining region Y)-box 2, nestin, vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and phosphoinositide-3-kinase (PI3K) were detected in 15 human samples of high-malignancy glioma and 12 human samples of low-malignancy glioma in vitro. The mRNA expression levels of VEGF and PI3K were higher in the high-malignancy group, as compared with in the low-malignancy group. In conclusion, the mRNA expression levels of VEGF and PI3K in glioma CSCs may be considered a novel criteria for the grading of glioma.']	('Wang', 'Lei')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']

['Cervical cancer is among the most prevalent forms of cancer worldwide. C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) is hypothesized to be a key functional protein involved in tumorigenesis. However, the role of CCR5 in cervical cancer remains unclear. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis were used to evaluate the mRNA and protein expression levels of CCR5 in human cervical carcinoma tissues. Furthermore, a small interfering RNA was employed to knockdown CCR5 in HeLa and C33A cells. MTT, colony formation and Transwell assays were performed to determine the effects of this knockdown on cell viability, proliferation and invasion. In addition, micro RNA (miR)-107 was identified as a potential candidate regulator of CCR5 using miR prediction algorithms, and the effects of miR-107 and its antisense miR on CCR5 mRNA expression were determined. The results of the present study indicated that CCR5 is overexpressed in human cervical cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues, and its downregulation inhibits cervical cancer cell growth and proliferation. Furthermore, the downregulation of CCR5 appears to suppress cervical cancer cell invasion. Finally, the tumor suppressor miR-107 was able to directly target CCR5 and inhibit its expression. These results suggest that the upregulation of CCR5, which is inhibited by miR-107, may play a carcinogenic role in cervical cancer and could provide a novel therapeutic target in the future.']	('Che', 'Li-Fan')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']

['An imbalance in the various T lymphocytes, including T-helper (Th)1, Th2 and Th17 cells, and regulatory T (Treg) cells, has been associated with immune dysfunction, and may occur following thoracotomy of patients with lung cancer. The use of transcutaneous acupoint electrical stimulation (TAES) has previously been demonstrated to exert immunoregulatory effects; therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate whether TAES was able to attenuate postoperative immune suppression in patients with lung cancer. Thoracic surgical patients with lung cancer (n=27) underwent TAES (frequency, 2/100 Hz; intensity, 4-12 mA) at the bilateral large intestine 4, pericardium 6, small intestine 3 and San Jiao 6 acupuncture points for 30 min, prior to incision, and at 20, 44, 68, 92 and 116 h following thoracotomy. The number of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells, and the protein and mRNA expression levels of related cytokines were measured by flow cytometry, ELISA and polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The balance of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells in the peripheral blood of patients with lung cancer was disrupted following thoracotomy. TAES administration increased the percentage of Th1 and Th17 cells, the protein expression levels of interleukin (IL)-2 and interferon-?, the mRNA expression levels of T-bet and RAR-related orphan receptor-?t, and decreased the percentage of Th2 cells, IL-10 protein expression levels, and GATA binding protein 3 mRNA expression levels. The results of the present study demonstrated that TAES was able to partially attenuate the postoperative immune depression of patients with lung cancer, by regulating the balance of Th1, Th2, Th17 and Treg cells, and the expression levels of related cytokines and transcription factors; therefore, TAES may be considered to be a promising strategy for treating postoperative immune dysfunction in patients with lung cancer.']	('Wu', 'Huaxing')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']

The expression of FRMD4A in rectal cancer and the corresponding normal adjacent tissues was detected by immunohistochemistry and western blotting. The expression of FRMD4A mRNA in peripheral blood was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The expression of FRMD4A in rectal cancer tissues was found to be negatively correlated with the degree of differentiation, depth of invasion and Dukes' stage. A negative correlation was identified between FRMD4A and epithelial cadherin expression. The expression of FRMD4A in the peripheral blood of patients with rectal cancer was significantly increased compared with that in the control group (P<0.05). Expression of FRMD4A in the peripheral blood in the patients with lymph node metastasis was significantly increased compared with that in the patients without lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). These results indicate that the expression of FRMD4A is significantly increased in rectal cancer tissues and the peripheral blood of patients with rectal cancer, and the expression levels of FRMD4A are closely associated with differentiation, invasion of rectal cancer and Dukes' stage.

['In the present study, the MGC803 gastric cancer cell line was used as an experimental model to evaluate the potential role of isobavachalcone (IBC) in cell apoptosis, migration and invasion. The inhibitory effects of IBC on cell proliferation were determined using a methylthiazolyltetrazolium assay. Cellular morphological changes were assessed using Wright-Giemsa staining, and cell apoptosis was evaluated by flow cytometric analysis. The results of the present study demonstrated that IBC inhibited the proliferation of MGC803 cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Furthermore, the wound healing and Matrigel Transwell® invasion assays demonstrated that IBC decreased cell migration and invasion in a concentration-dependent manner. Western blotting was used to determine the protein expression levels of caspase-3, B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), as well as the key protein kinases in the Akt and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) signaling pathways. During the IBC-induced apoptosis of MGC803 cells, transient activation of phosphorylated (p)-Akt and p-Erk inhibited the activation of Akt and Erk, upregulated Bax expression, downregulated Bcl-2 expression and activated caspase-3. These results suggest that IBC inhibited the growth of MGC803 gastric cancer cells by regulating the protein expression of caspase-3, Bcl-2 and Bax. In addition, inhibition of the Akt and Erk signaling pathways may be important mechanisms underlying the IBC-induced apoptosis of gastric cancer cells.']	('Jin', 'Xiaohong')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']

26891944	2016	08	Clinical implications of omics and systems medicine: focus on predictive and individualized treatment.	['Many patients with common diseases do not respond to treatment. This is a key challenge to modern health care, which causes both suffering and enormous costs. One important reason for the lack of treatment response is that common diseases are associated with altered interactions between thousands of genes, in combinations that differ between subgroups of patients who do or do not respond to a given treatment. Such subgroups, or even distinct disease entities, have been described recently in asthma, diabetes, autoimmune diseases and cancer. High-throughput techniques (omics) allow identification and characterization of such subgroups or entities. This may have important clinical implications, such as identification of diagnostic markers for individualized medicine, as well as new therapeutic targets for patients who do not respond to existing drugs. For example, whole-genome sequencing may be applied to more accurately guide treatment of neurodevelopmental diseases, or to identify drugs specifically targeting mutated genes in cancer. A study published in 2015 showed that 28% of hepatocellular carcinomas contained mutated genes that potentially could be targeted by drugs already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. A translational study, which is described in detail, showed how combined omics, computational, functional and clinical studies could identify and validate a novel diagnostic and therapeutic candidate gene in allergy. Another important clinical implication is the identification of potential diagnostic markers and therapeutic targets for predictive and preventative medicine. By combining computational and experimental methods, early disease regulators may be identified and potentially used to predict and treat disease before it becomes symptomatic. Systems medicine is an emerging discipline, which may contribute to such developments through combining omics with computational, functional and clinical studies. The aims of this review are to provide a brief introduction to systems medicine and discuss how it may contribute to the clinical implementation of individualized treatment, using clinically relevant examples.']	('Benson', 'M')	Journal of internal medicine	J.

Here, we discuss the recent advances in our understanding of the role of 3' end formation factors in promoting global changes in alternative splicing at internal exon-intron junctions and how they act as cofactors for well known splicing regulators.

Tumor excision is no longer possible in the majority of patients with malignant obstructive jaundice and duodenal obstruction. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effectiveness of intraluminal dual stent placement in malignant biliary and duodenal obstruction. In total, 20 patients with malignant obstructive jaundice and duodenal obstruction, including 6 with pancreatic carcinoma, 11 with cholangiocarcinoma, 1 with duodenal carcinoma and 2 with abdominal lymph node metastasis, were treated with intraluminal stent placement. Bile duct obstruction with late occurrence of duodenal obstruction was observed in 16 cases, and duodenal obstruction followed by a late occurrence of bile duct obstruction was observed in 3 cases, while, in 1 case, bile duct obstruction and duodenal obstruction occurred simultaneously. After X-ray fluoroscopy revealed obstruction in the bile duct and duodenum, stents were placed into the respective lumens. Percutaneous transhepatic placement was employed for the biliary stent, while the duodenal stent was placed perioraly. The clinical outcomes, including complications associated with the procedures and patency of the stents, were evaluated. The biliary and duodenal stents were successfully implanted in 18 patients and the technical success rate was 90% (18/20). A total of 39 stents were implanted in 20 patients. In 2 cases, duodenal stent placement failed following biliary stent placement. Duodenal obstruction remitted in 15 patients, and 1 patient succumbed to aspiration pneumonia 5 days after the procedure. No severe complications were observed in any other patient. The survival time of the 18 patients was 5-21 months (median, 9.6 months), and 6 of those patients survived for >12 months.

['It has previously been suggested that the upregulation of GluN2B-containing N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (GluN2B) within the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) may contribute to the development of chronic pain. The present study used a rat model of bone cancer pain in order to investigate whether lentiviral-mediated delivery of small interfering RNAs targeting GluN2B (LV-GluN2B) could attenuate pain associated with bone cancer, by selectively decreasing GluN2B expression within the rACC. Sprague Dawley rats were inoculated with osteosarcoma cells into the intramedullary space of the right tibia in order to induce persistent bone cancer-associated pain. Intra-rACC administration of the lentiviral siRNA was performed in the tumor bearing rats; and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were performed in order to detect the expression levels of GluN2B. Pain behavior changes were evaluated via paw withdrawal threshold and latency determinations. Marked and region-selective decreases in the mRNA and protein expression levels of GluN2B were detected in the rACC following the intra-rACC administration of LV-GluN2B. Furthermore, the rats also exhibited pain behavior changes corresponding to the decreased levels of GluN2B. By post-operative day 14, inoculation of osteosarcoma cells had significantly enhanced mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia in the rats, which were subsequently attenuated by the intra-rACC administration of LV-GluN2B. Notably, the paw withdrawal threshold and latency of the tumor-bearing rats had recovered to normal levels, by day 14 post-administration. The results of the present study suggest that GluN2B within the rACC may be a potential target for RNA interference therapy for the treatment of pain associated with bone cancer. Furthermore, the lentiviral vector delivery strategy may be a promising novel approach for the treatment of bone cancer pain.']	('Xu', 'Yongguang')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']

BIU-87 and T24 cells were transfected with the SIPA gene and SIPA short hairpin (sh)RNA, respectively. Western blot analysis was conducted to analyze the expression levels of SIPA-1, Ras-related protein 1 (Rap1), Rap1 guanosine triphosphate (Rap1GTP), E-cadherin and zona occludens-1 (ZO-1). Cell motility and invasion were evaluated in vitro using wound and Transwell assays. Transfected cells were inoculated into the pelvic region of BALB/c nude mice, and the number of resulting tumors was recorded after 6 weeks. Western blot analysis revealed that expression levels of E-cadherin and ZO-1 were reduced in the cells with enhanced levels of SIPA-1. By contrast, the levels of E-cadherin and ZO-1 were elevated in the cells in which SIPA-1 was knocked down. In comparison with untransfected cells, the cells with reduced levels of SIPA-1 exhibited reduced wound closure and fewer cells crossed the chamber in the Transwell experiment, whereas the cells with enhanced levels of SIPA-1 exhibited increased migration and invasion In vivo, an increased tumor count was obtained in the mice with elevated levels of SIPA-1. Therefore, the results of the present study indicate that SIPA-1 is able to regulate bladder cancer cell metastasis and invasion by reducing the expression of E-cadherin and ZO-1.']	('Zhang', 'Ping')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']

The present study describes the case of a 53-year-old female who presented with an irritating cough and a mass around the right sternoclavicular joint. Comprehensive evaluation revealed involvement of the mediastinum, lungs, right sternoclavicular joint and right kidney. Biopsies from the mediastinal and right sternoclavicular joint tumors showed features of adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry was positive for cytokeratin (CK)20 and caudal type homeobox transcription factor 2, and negative for CK7, thyroid transcription factor-1 and napsin A. Genotypic analysis identified the expression of wild-type epidermal growth factor receptor, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog, serine/threonine-protein kinase B-Raf and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 1-1. There was no expression of echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4-anaplastic lymphoma kinase and a moderate expression of excision repair cross-complementation group 1, ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase large subunit and tubulin ?-3 chain. A strong expression of thymidylate synthase and 677TC genotype expression of methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase was observed. Gastroscopy, enteroscopy, colorectal colonoscopy and positron emission tomography-computed tomography failed to find evidence of a gastrointestinal malignancy and primary lung enteric adenocarcinoma was diagnosed. The presence of multiple metastases did not permit curative surgery. The patient was treated with 3 monthly cycles of the XELOX chemotherapy regimen; the response was poor with progression of supraclavicular lesions. Treatment was switched to the TP regimen for 4 monthly cycles, which resulted in a significant reduction in the size of the lung lesions; however, the supraclavicular lesion responded poorly to the treatment. The patient then received 2 cycles of the FOLFIRI regimen; however, the lung and right supraclavicular lesions progressed, causing increased right upper limb pain. The pain was alleviated by palliative surgery. Following surgery, the DP regimen was employed. Follow-up of the patient remains ongoing.

The great concerns about public health that arose from the scientific evidence presented above have led to the banning of asbestos in several countries. Over the years, the suspicion that particles with a high aspect ratio may have asbestos-like pathogenicity has been supported by increasing evidence. Natural occurring minerals, as well as man-made fibres, have proven capable of inducing either chronic inflammation of serous membranes, or, in some cases, the development of peritoneal and pleural mesothelioma.

Cox multivariate analysis revealed that NUCKS overexpression was an independent factor for overall survival and recurrence-free survival (P < 0.001 for both). Multivariate logistic regression suggested that recurrence was independently correlated with NUCKS overexpresion (P = 0.039), FIGO stage (P = 0.002), and lymph node metastasis (P = 0.002).

['The available drug treatment options for adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) are limited. In our previous studies, the in vitro activity of 9-cis retinoic acid (9-cisRA) on adrenocortical NCI-H295R cells was shown along with its antitumoral effects in a small pilot xenograft study. Our aim was to dissect the antitumoral effects of 9-cisRA on ACC in a large-scale xenograft study involving mitotane, 9-cisRA and their combination. 43 male SCID mice inoculated with NCI-H295R cells were treated in four groups (i. control, ii. 9-cisRA, iii. mitotane, iv. 9-cisRA + mitotane) for 28 days. Tumor size follow-up, histological and immunohistochemical (Ki-67) analysis, tissue gene expression microarray, quantitative real-time-PCR for the validation of microarray results and to detect circulating microRNAs were performed. Protein expression was studied by proteomics and Western-blot validation. Only mitotane alone and the combination of 9-cisRA and mitotane resulted in significant tumor size reduction. The Ki-67 index was significantly reduced in both 9-cisRA and 9-cisRA+mitotane groups. Only modest changes at the mRNA level were found: the 9-cisRA-induced overexpression of apolipoprotein A4 and down-regulation of phosphodiesterase 4A was validated. The expression of circulating hsa-miR-483-5p was significantly reduced in the combined treatment group. The SET protein was validated as being significantly down-regulated in the combined mitotane+9-cisRA group. 9-cisRA might be a helpful additive agent in the treatment of ACC in combination with mitotane. Circulating hsa-miR-483-5p could be utilized for monitoring the treatment efficacy in ACC patients, and the treatment-induced reduction in protein SET expression might raise its relevance in ACC biology.']	('Nagy', 'Zoltán')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

"[""MicroRNAs (miRNAs) act as key regulators of gene expression and their dysregulation is linked to carcinogenesis and tumor progression. MiR-610 has been implicated as an anti-tumor miRNA in multiple types of cancers. However, its biological role and the underlying mechanism in colorectal cancer (CRC) have not been well explored. In this study, we report that miR-610 expression is decreased in CRC samples while ectopic expression of miR-610 suppresses cell proliferation, migration and invasion, and influences the expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated proteins by up-regulating E-cadherin expression and down-regulating vimentin expression. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we reveal that miR-610 directly targets hepatoma-derived growth factor (HDGF) by binding to its 3'UTR. A negative correlation was also observed between miR-610 and HDGF expression in CRC tissues. Further studies show that inhibition of HDGF recapitulates the anti-tumor function of miR-610, whereas re-expression of HDGF partially abrogates the inhibitory effects of miR-610. Collectively, our findings indicate that miR-610 exerts its function by directly targeting HDGF.

26885451	2015	11	Selective expression of constitutively active pro-apoptotic protein BikDD gene in primary mammary tumors inhibits tumor growth and reduces tumor initiating cells.	['Our previous study showed that specifically delivering BikDD, a constitutive active mutant of pro-apoptotic protein Bik, to breast cancer cell xenografts in immunocompromised mice has a potent activity against tumor initiating cells (TICs), and that the combination between tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) and BikDD gene therapy yielded synergistic effect on EGFR and HER2 positive breast cancer cells in immunodeficient nude mice. Those encouraging results have allowed us to propose a clinical trial using the liposome-complexing plasmid DNA expressing BikDD gene which has been approved by the NIH RAC Advisory committee. However, it is imperative to test whether systemic delivery of BikDD-expressing plasmid DNAs with liposomes into immunocompetent mice has therapeutic efficacy and tolerable side effects as what we observed in the nude mice model. In this study, we investigated the effects of BikDD gene-therapy on the primary mammary tumors, especially on tumor initiating cells (TICs), of a genetically engineered immunocompetent mouse harboring normal microenvironment and immune response. The effects on TIC population in tumors were determined by FACS analysis with different sets of murine specific TIC markers, CD49f(high)CD61(high) and CD24(+)Jagged1(-). First we showed in vitro that ectopic expression of BikDD in murine N202 cells derived from MMTV-HER2/Neu transgenic mouse tumors induced apoptosis and decreased the number of TICs. Consistently, systemic delivery of VISA-Claudin4-BikDD by liposome complexes significantly inhibited mammary tumor growth and slowed down residual tumor growth post cessation of therapy in MMTV-HER2/Neu transgenic mice compared to the controls. In addition, the anti-tumor effects of BikDD in vivo were consistent with decreased TIC population assessed by FACS analysis and in vitro tumorsphere formation assay of freshly isolated tumor cells. Importantly, systemic administration of BikDD did not cause significant cytotoxic response in standard toxicity assays or body weight changes. Taken together, our findings validated that selective expression of BikDD in the primary mammary tumors in immunocompetent hosts significantly reduced tumor burden and inhibited the residual tumor growth at off-therapy stage by eliminating TICs. Hence, the VISA-Claudin4-BikDD-mediated gene therapy is worthy of further investigation in breast cancer clinical trials.']	('Rahal', 'Omar M')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

['Lung cancer stem cells (CSCs) have recently been isolated from lung cancer patient samples and have been reported to be responsible for tumor initiation, treatment resistance and tumor recurrence. We have previously shown that oncolytic Newcastle disease virus (NDV), strain FMW (NDV/FMW) induces apoptosis in drug-resistant lung cancer cells. However, how NDV exerts its oncolytic effect on lung CSCs remains to be investigated. Here we show that NDV/FMW replicates in, and lyses CSC-enriched lung cancer spheroids and inhibits the 3D growth potential of lung cancer spheroid and agar colonies. We demonstrate that NDV/FMW triggers caspase-dependent apoptosis in lung cancer spheroids as shown by increased caspase-3 processing and Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Notably, NDV/FMW infection results in the degradation of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) II and P62, two hallmarks of autophagy maturation, indicating that NDV/FMW promotes autophagy flux in lung cancer cell spheroids. This was further confirmed by the appearance of an increased number of double-membrane vesicles as detected by transmission electron microscopy. We also show that NDV/FMW promotes autophagy degradation in lung cancer spheroids via inhibition of the AKT/mTOR pathway. In addition, treatment of spheroids with the autophagy inhibitor, chloroquine increases NDV/FMW-induced cytotoxicity. Collectively, our data show that oncolytic NDV/FMW may be a potential strategy in targeting lung CSCs.']	('Hu', 'Lulu')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

However, its effect on human salivary gland carcinoma is unknown. The effect of metformin alone or in combination with pp242 (an mTOR inhibitor) on salivary adenocarcinoma cells growth were determined in vitro and in vivo. We found that metformin suppressed HSY cell growth in vitro in a time and dose dependent manner associated with a reduced expression of MYC onco-protein, and the same inhibitory effect of metformin was also confirmed in HSG cells. In association with the reduction of MYC onco-protein, metformin significantly restored p53 tumor suppressor gene expression. The distinctive effects of metformin and PP242 on MYC reduction and P53 restoration suggested that metformin inhibited cell growth through a different pathway from PP242 in salivary carcinoma cells. Furthermore, the anti-tumor efficacy of metformin was confirmed in vivo as indicated by the increases of tumor necrosis and reduced proliferation in xenograft tumors from metformin treated group. For the first time, the inhibitory effect of metformin on human salivary gland tumor cells was documented. Moreover, metformin inhibitory effects were enhanced by mTOR inhibitor suggesting that metformin and mTOR inhibitor utilize distinctive signaling pathways to suppress salivary tumor growth.']	('Guo', 'Yuqi')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']
26885448	2015	11	Preclinical evaluation of afatinib (BIBW2992) in esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC).	['Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the eighth most common cancer worldwide. Epidermal growth factor receptors (EGFR) are often overexpressed in esophageal cancers, thus anti-EGFR inhibitors have been evaluated in ESCC. Afatinib was an irreversible inhibitor of these ErbB family receptors. This study characterized the preclinical activity of afatinib in five ESCC cell lines: HKESC-1, HKESC-2, KYSE510, SLMT-1 and EC-1. ESCC cell lines were sensitive to afatinib with IC50 concentrations at lower micro-molar range (at 72 hour incubation: HKESC-1 = 0.002 ?M, HKESC-2 = 0.002 ?M, KYSE510 = 1.090 ?M, SLMT-1 = 1.161 ?M and EC-1 = 0.109 ?M) with a maximum growth inhibition over 95%. Afatinib can strongly induce G0/G1 cell cycle arrest in HKESC-2 and EC-1 in a dose- and time-dependent manner. The phosphorylation of ErbB family downstream effectors such as pAKT, pS6 and pMAPK were significantly inhibited in HKESC-2 and EC-1. Apoptosis was observed in both cell lines at 24 hours after exposure to afatinib, as determined by the presence of cleaved PARP. Afatinib could effectively inhibit HKESC-2 tumor growth in mice without obvious toxicity. Afatinib alone has shown excellent growth inhibitory effect on ESCC in both in vitro and in vivo models, however, no synergistic effect was observed when it was combined with chemotherapeutic agents such as 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin. In summary, afatinib can inhibit cell proliferation effectively by arresting the cells in G0/G1 phase, as well as inducing apoptosis in ESCC. These findings warrant further studies of afatinib as therapeutic agent in treating ESCC.']	('Wong', 'Chi Hang')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

"[""Esophageal cancer is the sixth most common cancer in male causing death worldwide. It is usually diagnosed at advanced stage with high postoperative recurrence and systemic metastasis, which leads to poor prognosis.

In the present study, the anti-invasion activities of Andrographis paniculata (AP) have been evaluated in two esophageal cancer cell lines, EC-109 and KYSE-520, as well as human microvascular endothelial cells (HMEC-1). The anti-tumor and anti-metastatic activities of AP were also evaluated in human esophageal xenograft-bearing mouse models. Our results demonstrated for the first time that aqueous extract of AP inhibited the motility and invasion of esophageal cancer cells, which is the initial step of metastasis, without cytotoxicity. Anoikis resistance has also been reversed in AP-treated cancer cells. Besides, the expression of metastasis-related gene TM4SF3 in EC-109 cells was significantly decreased in AP extract-treated cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Furthermore, the anti-tumor and anti-metastatic efficacies in subcutaneous and intraperitoneal esophageal xenograft-bearing mice were demonstrated after oral administration of AP aqueous extract for 3 weeks. Last but not least, the active component, isoandrographolide, responsible for the anti-migratory activity was firstly revealed here. In conclusion, the AP aqueous extract exerted inhibitory activities on the migration and anoikis resistance of esophageal cancer cells EC-109 and KYSE-520, as well as suppressed the proliferation and motility of endothelial cells.

Here, we tested the potential of carglumic acid to be repurposed as an anticancer agent and showed that carglumic acid promotes apoptosis and inhibits cancer cell growth ina wide variety of human cancers, including pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), hepatoma, and lung cancer. Our data from in vivo models indicates that orally taking 10% of the carglumic acid dose currently used for the treatment of hyperammonemia ise ffective to suppress the growth of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomaand TNBC. If given intravenously, only 5% of the carglumic acid doseis needed to be effective against TNBC. These findings suggest that carglumic acid may serve as a safe and effective therapeutic to treat both TNBC and pancreatic cancer.']	('Chen', 'Chun-Te')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

['Volasertib (BI 6727), a highly selective and potent inhibitor of PLK1, has shown broad antitumor activities in the preclinical and clinical studies for the treatment of several types of cancers. However, the anticancer effect of volasertib on cervical cancer cells is still unknown. In the present study, we show that volasertib can markedly induce cell growth inhibition, cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase and apoptosis with the decreased protein expressions of PLK1 substrates survivin and wee1 in human cervical cancer cells. Furthermore, volasertib also enhances the intracellular reactive oxidative species (ROS) levels, and pretreated with ROS scavenger N-acety-L-cysteine totally blocks ROS generation but partly reverses volasertib-induced apoptosis. In addition, volasertib significantly potentiates the activity of cisplatin to inhibit the growth of cervical cancer in vitro and in vivo. In brief, volasertib suppresses tumor growth and potentiates the activity of cisplatin in cervical cancer, suggesting the combination of volasertib and cisplatin may be a promising strategy for the treatment of patients with cervical cancer.']	('Xie', 'Feng-Feng')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

"['Chemoradiation is the strongest anti-tumor therapy but in resistant unresectable cancers it often lacks safety and efficacy. We compared our recently developed cell-level combination approach, quadrapeutics, to chemoradiation therapy to establish pre-clinical data for its biodistribution, safety and efficacy in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), as a clinically challenging aggressive and resistant cancer. In vitro and in vivo models of four carcinomas were treated with standard chemoradiation and quadrapeutics using identical drug and radiation doses. We applied liposomal cisplatin or doxorubicin, colloidal gold, near-infrared laser pulses and radiation, all at low safe doses. The final evaluation used a xenograft model of HNSCC. Quadrapeutics enhanced standard chemoradiation in vitro by reducing head and neck cancer cell proliferation by 1000-fold, inhibiting tumor growth in vivo by 34-fold and improving animal survival by 5-fold, and reducing the side effects to a negligible level. In quadrapeutics, we observed an ""inversion"" of the drug efficacy of two standard drugs: doxorubicin, a low efficacy drug for the cancers studied, was two times more efficient than cisplatin, the first choice drug in clinic for HNSCC. The radical therapeutic gain of quadrapeutics resulted from the intracellular synergy of the four components employed which we administered in a specific sequence, while the reduction in the toxicity was due to the low doses of all four components. The biodistribution, safety and efficacy data for quadrapeutics in HNSCC ensure its high translational potential and justify the possibility of clinical trials.']"	('Lukianova-Hleb', 'Ekaterina Y')	American journal of cancer research	Am J Cancer Res	['eng']

High risk human papillomavirus (HPV) E6 and E7 oncoproteins expression are important for malignant transformation of cervical cancer cells. In particular, the E7 of high risk HPV binds to pRB family members (pRB, p107 and p130) for degradation. It has recently been discovered that the p107 and p130 'pocket proteins' are members of mammalian DREAM complexes.

Previous studies have shown that TOX play important roles in immune system. More recently, several studies have described TOX expression is frequently upregulated in diverse types of human tumors and the overregulation often associates with tumor progression. Moreover, TOXis involved in the control of cell apoptosis, growth, metastasis, DNA repair and so on.

['C4.4A, a member of the Ly6/uPAR family of membrane proteins, has been identified as a metastasis-associated molecule, but little is known about its actual expression and possible function in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). To explore diagnostic and prognostic roles of C4.4A in HNSCC, we investigated the expression of C4.4A in human HNSCC tissue array which contains 43 HNSCC, 6 epithelial dysplasia and 16 normal oral mucosa. Expression of C4.4A was significantly increased in epithelial dysplasia and HNSCC when compared with normal oral mucosa. Moreover, high C4.4A expression indicated a rather poor prognosis of HNSCC patients. To better understand the function of C4.4A in HNSCC progression, we investigated epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) associated proteins including transforming growth factor (TGF-?1), Slug and CD147 in HNSCC. The expression of TGF-?1, Slug, and CD147 was significantly increased in HNSCC when compared with normal oral mucosa. Meanwhile, the expression of C4.4A was significantly correlated with TGF-?1, Slug, and CD147 in HNSCC tissue array. Furthermore, knockdown of C4.4A decreased the cell invasion and migration in CAL27 cell line and suppressed the EMT with increased E-cadherin and decreased N-cadherin and Slug.

['Aberrant miRNA expression is implicated in tumorigenesis. However, the role of miRNAs in bladder urothelial carcinoma still remains largely unknown. In this study, miR-199a-5p was validated to be significantly down-regulated in bladder urothelial carcinoma. In addition, restoring expression of miR-199a-5p inhibited the tumorigenesis of bladder urothelial carcinoma in vitro and in vivo by inducing the apoptosis and suppressing the proliferation of bladder cancerous cells. Further investigation reported that MLK3 was a direct target of miR-199a-5p. Moreover, the expression level of miR-199a-5p was conversely correlated with MLK3 in bladder cancerous cells. In addition, reintroduction of MLK3 was identified to promote the proliferation and inhibit the apoptotic rate of cells, which have been altered by miR-199a-5p through activating the NF-?B pathway.

As of now, the exact role of B7-H3 expression in human esophageal cancer still remains elusive. In the present study, we characterized the B7-H3 expression in the human esophageal cancer cell line Eca-109 and TE-1, and in 174 cases of human esophageal cancer tissues, and to analyze its clinical implications and its correlation to T cell infiltration. By using the RNA interference method to down-regulate the B7-H3 expression in human esophageal cancer cell line Eca-109, we further studied the contribution of high B7-H3 expression to the biological features of this malignancy. Our results showed that B7-H3 was highly expressed in the cell line Eca-109 and TE-1, the high expression level of B7-H3 in esophageal cancer tissues was significantly associated with tumor invasion and patient's poor survival. Moreover, the higher B7-H3 expression was significantly and inversely correlated to the CD3(+)T cells infiltration in tumor nest of esophageal cancer tissues. We successfully constructed the recombinant lentivirus of siRNA targeting B7-H3, and the cellular studies showed that the down regulation of B7-H3 expression could suppress the proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion in Eca-109 cells, which was consistent with the finding from the clinical sample cohort study. Collectively, the high B7-H3 expression was involved in the cancer progression of human esophageal cancer, and might contributed to the negative regulation of T-cell mediated antitumor response in tumor microenvironment, and the proliferation and mobility of esophageal cancer cells.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the predictive ability of miR-29c, miR-124, miR-135a and miR-148a for lymph node metastasis (LNM) and tumor stage in gastric cancer. The expression of these miRNAs was detected and quantitated in gastric cancer tissues and in adjacent normal tissues from 60 patients by quantitative real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. CT imaging and clinicopathologic characteristics of these patients were performed. The result of this study was that these miRNAs were down-regulated in gastric cancer tissues; The low expression of miR-124 and miR-135a in LNM group and tumor III-IV stages (P < 0.01) presented the potential correlation with LNM and tumor stage; The two miRNAs were highly correlated with r = 0.730. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that miR-124 had better predictive ability to identify LNM and tumor stage. It could discriminate non-LNM from LNM with 80.0% sensitivity and 80.0% specificity and discriminate tumor ?-II stages from tumor III-IV stages with 71.9% sensitivity and 75.0% specificity at the best cut-off value of 0.0125.

"[""The identification of reliable prognostic markers that distinguish patients' status and predict therapeutic response can improve the clinical outcomes of pancreatic cancer patients. The epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is known to be highly expressed in cancers and serves as a prognosis factor. Generally, membranous EpCAM expression in cancer cells and its clinical significance are evaluated. However, there is also an evidence of cytoplasmic EpCAM distribution in cancer cells. Hence, we investigated which kind of the immunostaining pattern in pancreatic cancer patients was, and whether membranous or cytoplasmic immunostaining had clinical significance. We determined the cytoplasmic or membranous EpCAM expression by a well-established immunohistochemical staining protocol in 157 pairs of carcinoma and paired adjacent non-tumor pancreatic tissue samples using the EpCAM-specific antibody. Furthermore, we evaluated the relationship between tumoral EpCAM expression of resected specimens and patient's overall survival as well as other biological variables like clinical prognosis by Kaplan-Meier method and ?(2) test. We found that pancreatic cancer patients had expressed higher level of cytoplasmic EpCAM but lower level of membranous EpCAM, and their expressions were significantly correlated. Cytoplasmic EpCAM acted as a favorable prognosis factor on survival time in patients with HBV negative infection. Pancreatic cancer patients with cytoplasmic EpCAM over-expression and negative Hepatitis B virus infection might benefit further from post-surgery chemotherapy. These data suggested a potential role of cytoplasmic EpCAM in predicting patient's prognosis and determining therapeutic strategy.""]"	('Meng', 'Yao')	International journal of clinical and experimental medicine	Int J Clin Exp Med	['eng']

The purpose of this study was to systematically investigate the clinical and prognostic significance of HIF-1? expression in patients with glioma. Relevant studies published between 2000 and 2015 were searched in the electronic databases. The odds ratio (OR), risk ratio (RR) and mean difference (MD) with their 95% confidence intervals (CI) were employed to calculate the strength of significance. Finally, a total of 24 articles were retrieved, including 1422 glioma patients. No significant heterogeneity was presented between studies (I(2)<50%, P>0.01). Overall, our results showed that HIF-1? expression was significantly associated with high WHO grade (III+IV) of glioma (OR=8.59, 95% CI=6.56-11.24, P<0.00001). This significant relationship was also found between HIF-1? expression and microvascular density (MD=26.32, 95% CI=14.48-38.16, P<0.0001), overall survival (OS) (3-year OS: RR=0.48, 95% CI=0.35-0.66, P<0.00001; 2-year OS: RR=0.53, 95% CI=0.38-0.73, P<0.0001; 1-year OS: RR=0.79, 95% CI=0.66-0.95, P=0.01), and the cumulative survival time.

The subtypes have shown diversity in terms of prognosis, clinicopathological and molecular characteristics, with ER+/PR+/HER2- and ER-/PR-/HER2+ group exhibiting exceptionally benign and aggressive behavior, respectively. We have further characterized the subtypes in the context of pathways known to drive endometrial carcinogenesis: phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)-AKT pathway (ERBB/PI3K pathway), TP53 system, and the mismatch repair (MMR) mechanism. Analysis of tumor heterogeneity was also included. ER+/PR+/HER2+ was characterized by active ERBB/PI3K pathway occurring in 58% of cases. Subtype ER-/PR-/HER2+ was characterized by the most frequent TP53 mutations (83% of cases). Triple negative phenotype utterly lacked active ERBB/PI3K pathway. Analyzed major pathways rarely correlated with clinicopathologial data but mutated TP53 and retained MMR did correlate with shorter overall survival (both P<0.01). The presence of tumor heterogeneity was most frequent in ER-/PR-/HER2+ subtype (53% of all cases). The presented results further emphasize that the molecular subtype distinction, along with MMR and TP53 status, could be a useful diagnostic tool in guiding individualized therapy.']	('?api?ska-Szumczyk', 'Sylwia M')	International journal of clinical and experimental medicine	Int J Clin Exp Med	['eng']

['This study sought to evaluate the dosimetric impact of tumor bed delineation variability (based on clips, seroma or both clips and seroma) during external-beam partial breast irradiation (EB-PBI) planned utilizing four-dimensional computed tomography (4DCT) scans. 4DCT scans of 20 patients with a seroma clarity score (SCS) 3~5 and ?5 surgical clips were included in this study. The combined volume of the tumor bed formed using clips, seroma, or both clips and seroma on the 10 phases of 4DCT was defined as the internal gross target volume (termed IGTVC, IGTVS and IGTVC+S, respectively). A 1.5-cm margin was added by defining the planning target volume (termed PTVC, PTVS and PTVC+S, respectively). Three treatment plans were established using the 4DCT images (termed EB-PBIC, EB-PBIS, EB-PBIC+S, respectively). The results showed that the volume of IGTVC+S was significantly larger than that of IGTVCand IGTVS. Similarly, the volume of PTVC+S was markedly larger than that of PTVC and PTVS. However, the PTV coverage for EB-PBIC+S was similar to that of EB-PBIC and EB-PBIS, and there were no significant differences in the homogeneity index or conformity index between the three treatment plans (P=0.878, 0.086). The EB-PBIS plan resulted in the lowest ipsilateral normal breast and ipsilateral lung doses compared with the EB-PBIC and EB-PBIC+S plans. To conclude, the volume variability delineated based on clips, seroma or both clips and seroma resulted in dosimetric variability for organs at risk, but did not show a marked influence on the dosimetric distribution.']	('Guo', 'Bing')	International journal of clinical and experimental medicine	Int J Clin Exp Med	['eng']

Receptor determination exists as a marker with predictive value rather than prognostic importance. Patients with invasive breast cancer (n=2849) were investigated retrospectively between 1981 and 2013. Patients were separated to four subgroups, as follows: ER+; non-luminal HER2+; ER-/PR-/HER2-; ER-PR+. We investigated the effects of ER positivity on long-term survival in breast cancers, by considering their pathological properties, surgical method applications, chemotherapy preferences, and combined hormonal treatments with regard to ER, PR and HER2 status. ER+ cases were premenopausal, and they existed with low-grade, small-sized and early stage tumors (P<0.05). One thousand three hundred and eighty five cases (68.6%) were administered chemotherapy, which was followed by hormone therapy. Non-luminal HER2+ tumors were found to exhibit longer survival, when compared to triple negative and ER- tumors (P=0.010). Triple negative cases had the shortest survival rates; survival values determined in the HER2+ and ER-/PR+ cases were found to be between the survivals of ER+ and TN tumors. ER, PR and HER2 positivity was not concomitant with a risk of recurrence (P>0.05). Furthermore, recurrence risk rose significantly when age, tumor stage and tumor grade increased (P<0.05). ER+ tumors are observed in women of advanced age, but have a good clinical response. Currently, receptor determination is still generally preferred as a practical application. ER analysis in the early stage breast cancers for women of advanced ages must be considered as an indicator of anti-estrogenic therapy administration, rather than prognostic importance.']	('Bulut', 'Nilufer')	International journal of clinical and experimental medicine	Int J Clin Exp Med	['eng']

['Previous studies report controversial role of Hedgehog (HH) signaling in the progression of colon cancer. This study aimed to investigate the expressions of smoothened (SMO) and downstream glioma-associated oncogene homology-1 (GLI1) in colon cancer, colonic adenoma and normal tissues. Colon cancer and normal tissue samples were collected from 49 patients with colon cancer while colonic adenoma tissue samples were obtained from 34 patients with colonic adenoma. Then the expressions of SMO and GLI1 were investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC). For the detection of SMO and GLI1 expression, IHC staining results indicated that SMO was mainly expressed on the membrane while GLI1 was mainly expressed in the cytoplasm. The positive rates of SMO and GLI1 protein expressions were significantly increased in colon cancer tissue and colonic adenoma tissue when compared with normal colon tissue. In contrast, the significant difference was not found in the positive rates of SMO and GLI1 protein expressions between colon cancer tissue and colonic adenoma tissue. More importantly, it was found that SMO and GLI1 expressions possibly increased gradually from the normal colon to colonic adenoma to the colon cancer. Furthermore, no distinct correlations were detected between the expression levels of SMO and GLI1 and clinicopathological parameters, including age, gender, differentiation and Dukes stage. The present results provided some new information to the possible role of HH signaling in colon cancer progression.

Among 585 patients diagnosed with GIST from January 2005 to July 2014, 32 (5.5%) had synchronous digestive tract carcinoma, including 19 (59.4%) men and 13 (40.6%) women. The median age was 64 years (range, 43-84). GIST was located in the stomach (n=24), small intestine (n=6), duodenum (n=1) and retroperitoneum (n=1). GISTs were intra- or postoperatively discovered (n=28) or preoperatively identified (n=4). The tumor size was less than 10 mm (microGIST) in 23 (71.9%) GIST patients. The preoperatively identified GIST subgroup showed a significantly larger tumor size, more mitotic figures and a higher risk grade than the intra- or postoperatively identified GIST subgroup. Concurrent digestive tract carcinomas were most frequently located in the stomach (24 cases, 75%). The other involved sites were the esophagus (n=5), duodenum (n=2) and colon (n=1). With a median follow-up of 32 months (range, 9-80), 24 patients were alive without evidence of disease, 6 patients had died of carcinoma progression, 1 patient had died from an accident, and 1 patient experienced GIST metastasis to the liver. In summary, we discovered that 5.5% of GIST patients also developed a concurrent digestive tract carcinoma in a series of 585 GIST cases. The majority of GISTs are incidentally identified microGISTs. The concurrent carcinoma seems to have a greater unfavorable effect on prognosis than the GIST. However, for a GIST that is identified preoperatively with a high risk of progression, adjuvant therapy is warranted.']	('Zhang', 'Peng')	International journal of clinical and experimental medicine	Int J Clin Exp Med	['eng']

The overall ratio of metastatic lymph node (positive lymph nodes/lymph nodes harvested) in the splenic hilum was 17.5% (38/217). Univariate analysis results showed SHLNM was related with depth of invasion, tumor grade, tumor size, tumor location and Bormann type, with significant difference (P<0.05); Multivariate analysis demonstrated that SHLNM was related with depth of invasion and tumor size, with significant difference (P<0.05). Consequently, depth of invasion, tumor grade, tumor size, tumor location and Bormann type were associated with SHLNM in AGC, meanwhile depth of invasion and tumor size are independent risk factors.

This retrospective study included 127 EOC patients. Data related to patient demographics, cancer stages, grades, histology, operation procedures, residual disease, adjuvant chemotherapy, recurrence, and survival were collected. A total of 134 ovarian carcinoma tissue specimens and 40 matching borderline ovarian tumor specimens were chosen from the pathology department archives. Immunohistochemistry was used to assess HE4 expression in EOC and borderline ovarian tumor tissue specimens. Of the 127 patients, there were 42 type I EOC patients (7 low grade serous carcinomas, 8 mucinous carcinomas, 12 low grade endometrioid carcinomas and 15 clear cell carcinomas) and 85 type II EOC patients (83 high grade serous carcinomas and 2 high grade endometrioid carcinomas). The median followed--up time was 18.3 months. There were significant differences between the two types of EOC in terms of the menopausal state, FIGO stage and pathological differentiation, but there were no differences in the residual tumor and chemotherapy treatment. In type I EOC, the median follow--up time was 31 months and the median progression--free survival was 72 months (95% CI: 40.34-103.66). There were 15 (35.7%) relapsed or progressive patients. In type II EOC, the median follow-up time was 17 months (0-60 m), and the median progression--free survival was 27 months (95% CI: 17.83-36.17). There were 47 (55.3%) relapsed or progressive patients. There was a significant difference between the two types of EOCs in terms of progression--free survival (P<0.001). Among the 44 type I specimens, 25 demonstrated positive expression of HE4 (56.8%). In contrast, 78 (86.7%) type II EOC demonstrated positive expression levels. There was a significant difference between type I and type II EOCs in terms of HE4 expression. Additionally, there was a significant difference between high grade serous carcinoma and borderline serous tumor, but no difference was observed between low grade serous carcinoma and borderline serous tumor or other types of EOC and corresponding borderline tumors. The different clinicopathologic characteristics between type I and type II EOC indicate that the two--tier EOC system reasonable and reliable. HE4 would be a powerful biomarker to distinguish type II EOC from borderline tumors but it is less useful in type I EOC. Type I EOC is generated from the corresponding borderline tumor.']	('Jiang', 'Jinghong')	International journal of clinical and experimental medicine	Int J Clin Exp Med	['eng']

Sixty-eight tumors were classified as MSI-H by MSI test. Colorectal carcinomas with MSI-H were prone to be proximal located, poorly differentiated, and relatively early staged, with infrequent metastasis to lymph node as well as to distant organs, compared with MSS ones. All of the 68 MMRd CRCs presented abnormal expression of at least one mismatch repair protein (MMRP), with 48 concurrent negative of MLH1 and PMS2, 14 concurrent negative of MSH2 and MSH6, 4 isolated negative of MSH6, 1 isolated negative of PMS2, and 1 concurrent negative of 4 MMRPs.

STAT3 is often associated with cell survival, proliferation, and transformation. The prognostic value of STAT3/pSTAT3 in patients with gastric cancer remains controversial in numerous published studies. The aim of this study was to summarize recent findings relevant to the prognostic role of STAT3 and pSTAT3 in patients with gastric cancer. A meta-analysis was performed by searching Web of Knowledge, EMBASE, and PubMed to identify studies on the prognostic impact of STAT3/pSTAT3 in gastric cancers in August 2014. In all, 10 studies were included in the analysis. Data were collected for comparing survival rates in patients with high STAT3 levels compared to those with low levels. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated. Sensitivity analysis was conducted, and publication bias was evaluated. Eventually, 1667 cases of gastric cancer were subjected to the final analysis. Among patients with gastric cancer, poor survival was predicted by higher expressions of STAT3 (HR=2.30; 95% CI=1.13-4.68; P=0.02) and pSTAT3 (HR=1.75; 95% CI=1.17-2.61; P=0.006).

['The present study assessed the predictive value of (99m)Tc-3(poly-(ethylene glycol), PEG) 4-arginine-glycine-aspartic ((99m)Tc-3P-RGD2) single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) for the early identification of response to antiangiogenic treatment with bevacizumab in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with advanced NSCLC treated with bevacizumab were prospectively studied with (99m)Tc-3P-RGD2 SPECT before and after 2 weeks from start of treatment. The tumor response was evaluated with RECIST criteria and related to observed change in the tumor to non-tumor (T/N) ratio for the largest known lesion. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine T/N ratio changes with regard to predicting response to bevacizumab therapy. Change in T/N ratio was also related to progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Twenty-six patients were included, and 23 were finally assessable for metabolic response evaluation with (99m)Tc-3P-RGD2 SPECT. The cut-off value of T/N ratio change defined by ROC analysis was 24.4%. The sensitivity, specificity, and negative predictive value of (99m)Tc-3P-RGD2 SPECT for predicting tumor response were 81.8%, 91.7%, and 84.6%, respectively. Using the cut-off value defined by ROC analysis on (99m)Tc-3P-RGD2 SPECT, metabolic non-progressive disease patients (mNP) showed prolonged PFS (5.6 months versus 3.4 months; P < 0.001) and OS (17.1 months versus 8.6 months; P < 0.001) than metabolic progressive disease patients (mP). (99m)Tc-3P-RGD2 SPECT scan is a promising test to predict tumor response in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer early in the course of bevacizumab therapy.']	('Chen', 'Bin')	International journal of clinical and experimental pathology	Int J Clin Exp Pathol	['eng']

['C-reactive protein (CRP) is a biomarker of inflammation and the production has been shown to be influenced by genetic variation in CRP gene. HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a typical inflammation-related disease occurs mainly in men. The present study was designed to investigate the association between CRP polymorphisms and HBV-related HCC risk in a Chinese male population. The CRP rs2794521 and rs3093059 SNPs were genotyped by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism method (PCR-RFLP) in 158 HBV patients with HCC, 207 HBV patients without HCC, and 150 unrelated healthy controls. A significant increased HCC risk in HBV patients were observed for the rs3093059 SNP comparing with those without HCC (C allele vs. T allele: adjusted OR=1.56, 95% CI, 1.07-2.29, P=0.021; TC vs. TT: adjusted OR=1.77, 95% CI, 1.13-2.76, P=0.012; TC/CC vs. TT: adjusted OR=1.76, 95% CI, 1.14-2.71, P=0.011). However, we did not observe any significant association of rs3093059 polymorphism with HCC when compared with healthy controls. With respect to rs2794521 polymorphism, no significant associations of this polymorphism with HCC risk were found in this population. In haplotype analysis between HBV patients with HCC and HBV patients without HCC, the TC haplotype was found correlated with a significant increased HCC risk (OR=1.803, 95% CI, 1.237-2.335, P<0.001).

Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves and area under the curves (AUC) of the proteins were calculated. Results showed that plasma levels of LTBP-1 were significantly higher in HCC patients than those in other three groups. LTBP-1 showed a better diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.67-0.80) in distinguishing HCC from the CHB or cirrhosis patients, compared to AFP (AUC = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.52-0.65).

IFITM1 was overexpressed in colonic cancer tissues but not in rectal cancer tissues, compared to control normal tissues. The expression of IFITM1 was significantly higher in patients with poor differentiation (P=0.031). The patients with higher IFITM1 expression had worse overall survival outcomes than those with lower IFITM1 expression in rectal cancer (P=0.037). Univariate Cox regression suggested that older age and poorly differentiation status predict shorter overall survival in colorectal cancer (P<0.05).

Patients with CD30-positive DLBCLs showed better progression-free survival and overall survival compared with patients with CD30-negative DLBCLs, although the superior outcome of CD30 positivity had minimal effects on BCL2+ DLBCL or DLBCL with MYC/BCL2 co-expression. Moreover, CD30 could express in CD5+ DLBCL. We concluded that CD30 may be useful as a prognostic marker in rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (R-CHOP) treated DLBCLs, indicating favorable outcomes in a Chinese population. Further studies with larger samples should be performed to investigate the function of CD30 expression in BCL2+ DLBCLs, DLBCLs with MYC/BCL2 co-expression, and CD5+ DLBCLs, and to evaluate the feasibility of anti-CD30 targeted treatment in DLBCL therapy.']	('Gong', 'Qi-Xing')	International journal of clinical and experimental pathology	Int J Clin Exp Pathol	['eng']

MicroRNA-21 (miR-21) is one important tumor growth regulatory factor involving in angiogenesis, tumor invasion and metastasis. This study thus aimed to investigate the role of high-risk HPV16 E7 protein in regulating miR-21 expression in cervical carcinoma and its related functions. Hela cells were transfected with pcDNA-HPV16 E7 expressing vectors. The expression level of E7 was determined by Western blotting, while miR-21 level was quantified by real-time PCR. The alternation of tumor cell proliferation is determined by transfecting miR-21 inhibitor into E7-overexpressing Hela cells. Cell apoptosis was studied by caspase-3 assay, while cell invasion was illustrated in Transwell chamber. The overexpression of HPV E7 protein facilitated the expression of miR-21, which potentiated Hela cell proliferation and invasion. The inhibition of miR-21 in E7-overexpressin Hela cells can inhibit both proliferation and invasion, but without significant effects on caspase-3 activity. HPV16 E7 protein can up-regulate host miR-21 expression, thus elevating cervical carcinoma cell growth, proliferation and invasion.

Surgical resection NSCLC specimens were collected from 74 patients undergoing surgery in our hospital from September 2003 to July 2008; tumor-adjacent normal tissue specimens were collected as controls. All cases were pathologically confirmed after surgery, and pathological data were complete for all patients. The expression of TAK1/TAB1 proteins in NSCLC and adjacent cancer tissues was detected by immunohistochemical analysis. The correlation between TAK1/TAB1 protein expression and the clinicopathological features and outcome of NSCLC was assessed. The positive expression ratio of TAK1 in NSCLC tissue was 63.5%, which was significantly higher than that in tumor-adjacent normal tissue (31.1%). The positive expression ratio of TAB1 in NSCLC tissue was 51.4%, which was significantly higher than that in tumor-adjacent normal tissue (24.3%). Further analysis showed that positive protein expression of TAK1 and TAB1 was unrelated to patient gender, age, tumor size, degree of differentiation, and history of smoking (P>0.05) but was significantly related to clinical stage and lymph node metastasis (P<0.05). Additionally, the expression of TAK1 as well as TAB1 was negatively related to NSCLC patient prognosis, and patients with positive protein expression had a significantly lower 5-year survival rate than those with negative protein expression (P<0.05). TAK1/TAB1 expression in NSCLC tissue is significantly increased and closely associated with patient clinical prognosis.

Actually, about less than thirty cases have been reported in scientific literatures. The aetiology and pathogenesis of this pathological double dental inclusion remain unknown; above all events that lead two molars to appear, as KMs remain mysterious. The association to metabolic connective diseases such as mucopolysaccharidosis was emphasized. KMs considered as an isolated event, may be associated to an abnormal position of the tooth-bud from lower permanent molars, or fourth supernumerary tooth (distomolar). Recently, hyperplastic dental follicle (HDF), with a down regulation of matrix metal-proteinases and up regulation of several genes of collagens, has been mentioned in association with KMs. In this paper, after having analyzed three new cases of KMs that have been treated, we report a new hypothesis. This last is based on the failure in the dental follicle's ability to initiate or continue properly resorption of the overlying alveolar bone, by many exogenous factors which may act on eruptive phase that would lead to its rotation with its contents coming out a pathological situation of KMs. The therapy of choice is related to the surgical removal of KMs through a double odontectomy with transalveolar method.

Patients may be asymptomatic, and malrotation is detected during investigations, operation or autopsy. It can cause longstanding abdominal symptoms like pain, dyspepsia or acute abdomen due to volvulus. In adults, malrotation is found with different gastrointestinal malignancies like gastric, hepatobiliary, pancreatic and, in particular, colorectal neoplasms. We are reporting a case of 60-year-old female presented with carcinoma caecum along with malrotation of the gut. It is the first case report from India. We also reviewed documented cases of malrotation associated with colorectal malignancies. A large number of cases have been reported in Japan as compared to rest of the world. Malrotation in adults is probably associated with gastrointestinal malignancies. Possible causes of this association can be genetic factors or gut changes like chronic inflammation. These associations need further study to consider intestinal malrotation as premalignant lesion which may be very important in follow-up of children with malrotation.']	('Ray', 'Dipankar')	The Indian journal of surgery	Indian J Surg	['eng']

Furthermore, we aim to investigate whether there are any potential benefits to this combined technique. Retrospective study of 230 clinically node-negative patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery for single T1-T3 tumours between 2006 and 2011. Axillae were staged using a combined blue dye SLNB/ANS technique. SLNs were localized in 226/230 (identification rate 98.3\xa0%). Three of one hundred ninety-two patients with a negative SLN were found to have positive ANS nodes and 1/4 failed SLNB patients had positive ANS nodes. Thirty-four of two hundred twenty-six patients had SLN metastases and 11/34 (32.4\xa0%) also had a positive non-sentinel lymph node on ANS. Twenty-one of twenty-four (87.5\xa0%) node-positive T1 tumours had single node involvement. Nine of thirty-eight node-positive patients progressed to completion axillary clearance (cALND), and the rest were treated with axillary radiotherapy. Axillary recurrence was nil at median 5\xa0year follow-up. Complementing SLNB with axillary node sampling (ANS) decreases the unavoidable false-negative rate associated with SLNB. Appropriate operator experience and technique can result in an SLN localization rate of 98\xa0%, rivalling a dual tracer technique. The additional insight offered by ANS into the status of non-sentinel nodes has potential applications in an era of less frequent cALND.']	('Edwards', 'K J')	The Indian journal of surgery	Indian J Surg	['eng']

['Colorectal adenocarcinoma is the second cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States. The occurrence of squamous cell carcinoma in the colorectum is extremely unusual. Malignant transformation from mature cystic teratoma of the ovary is a rare event. The most common transformation is squamous cell carcinoma, followed by adenocarcinoma. It occurs more often in elderly patients, who usually present with advance disease. We report two unusual cases of postmenopausal women diagnosed with squamous cell carcinoma in colon biopsies. After surgical resections, the carcinoma was proven to be the result of malignant transformation of ovarian mature cystic teratomas. Since squamous cell carcinoma of the colorectum is extremely rare, the presence of squamous cell carcinoma in a colonic biopsy in a female patient should alert the clinicians to other possible primary sites, as seen in these cases.']	('Rojas', 'Claudia P')	Case reports in pathology	Case Rep Pathol	['eng']

['The degradation of tryptophan (TRP) along the kynurenine pathway plays a crucial role as a neuro- and immunomodulatory mechanism in response to inflammatory stimuli, such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS). In endotoxemia or sepsis, an enhanced activation of the rate-limiting enzyme indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is associated with a higher mortality risk. It is assumed that IDO induced immunosuppressive effects provoke the development of a protracted compensatory hypoinflammatory phase up to a complete paralysis of the immune system, which is characterized by an endotoxin tolerance. However, the role of IDO activation in the development of life-threatening immunoparalysis is still poorly understood. Recent reports described the impact of inflammatory IDO activation and aryl hydrocarbon receptor- (AhR-) mediated pathways on the development of LPS tolerance and immune escape of cancer cells. These immunosuppressive mechanisms offer new insights for a better understanding of the development of cellular dysfunctions in immunoparalysis. This review provides a comprehensive update of significant biological functions of TRP metabolites along the kynurenine pathway and the complex regulation of LPS-induced IDO activation. In addition, the review focuses on the role of IDO-AhR-mediated immunosuppressive pathways in endotoxin tolerance and carcinogenesis revealing the significance of enhanced IDO activity for the establishment of life-threatening immunoparalysis in sepsis.']	('Wirthgen', 'Elisa')	Journal of amino acids	J Amino Acids	['eng']

['Recent advances in tumor genetics and drug development have led to the generation of a wealth of anti-cancer-targeted therapies. These drugs aim at targeting a particular vulnerability in the tumor generated in most cases as a result of dependence on an oncogene and/or loss of a tumor suppressor. Genes in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway are the most frequently altered in human cancers. Aberrant activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway has been shown to confer resistance to HER2-targeted therapies. Several drugs targeting PI3K/ATK have been developed and are currently in clinical trials in different phases of clinical development, alone or in combination. The impact of mutations in the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT pathway in HER2-amplified breast cancers will be the focus of this review.']	('Mayer', 'Ingrid A')	Current breast cancer reports	Curr Breast Cancer Rep	['eng']

['Doxorubicin (DOX) is a widely used antineoplastic drug whose efficacy is limited by its cardiotoxicity. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible protective role of the antidiabetic drugs metformin (250\u2009mg/kg dissolved in DW p.o. for seven days) and sitagliptin (10\u2009mg/kg dissolved in DW p.o. for seven days) in a model of DOX-induced (single dose 15\u2009mg/kg i.p. at the fifth day) cardiotoxicity in rats. Results of our study revealed that pretreatment with metformin or sitagliptin produced significant (P < 0.05) cardiac protection manifested by a significant decrease in serum levels of LDH and CK-MB enzymes and cardiac MDA and total nitrites and nitrates levels, a significant increase in cardiac SOD activity, and remarkable improvement in the histopathological features as well as a significant reduction in the immunohistochemical expression of COX-2, iNOS, and caspase-3 enzymes as compared to DOX group. These results may suggest using metformin and/or sitagliptin as preferable drugs for diabetic patients suffering from cancer and receiving DOX in their chemotherapy regimen.']	('Kelleni', 'Mina Thabet')	Journal of toxicology	J Toxicol	['eng']

We sought to determine the relationship between CADM1/TSLC1 expression and clinicopathological characteristics in patients with esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) and the correlation with survival. Materials and Methods. Two hundred and ninety-three ESCC tissues and paired adjacent normal esophageal tissues were immunohistochemically assessed in this study. The association of CADM1/TSLC1 with clinicopathological parameters, as well as disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS), was determined based on the Kaplan-Meier method and Cox regression models. Results. CADM1/TSLC1 was detected in 236 (80.5%) tumor tissues and 19 (8.0%) paired adjacent normal esophageal tissues. Decreased CADM1/TSLC1 expression was correlated with more advanced histological grade. CADM1/TSLC1 negative tumors were more frequently observed in male cases than in female cases. DFS and OS in the CADM1/TSLC1 negative group were significantly shorter than those in the positive group, particularly in male patients with ESCC. Conclusion. Loss or reduction of CADM1/TSLC1 expression is associated with more advanced histological grade and predicts early recurrence and short survival duration. Thus, loss of CADM1/TSLC1 could be a prognostic factor that can be used to assess the risk of recurrence and survival.']	('Zeng', 'De')	Gastroenterology research and practice	Gastroenterol Res Pract	['eng']

However this function is complicated by ultrasound contrast of the tissue varying with contact pressure exerted by the probe. The knowledge of the contact pressure is beneficial for a variety of screening and diagnostic procedures involving ultrasound. This paper introduces a solid-state sensor array which measures the contact pressure distribution between the probe and the tissue marginally affecting the ultrasound imaging capabilities. The probe design utilizes the dielectrostriction mechanism which relates the change in dielectric properties of the sensing layer to deformation. The concept, structure, fabrication, and performance of this sensor array are discussed. The prototype device is highly tolerant to overloads (>1 MPa tested) and provides stress measurements in the range of 0.14 to 10 kPa. Its loss of ultrasound transmissivity is less 3dB at 9 MHz ultrasound frequency. This performance is satisfactory for clinical and biomedical research in ultrasound image formation and interpretation, however for commercial product, a higher ultrasound transmissivity is desired. Directions for improving the sensor ultrasound transparency and electrical performance are discussed. The sensor array described in this paper has been developed specifically for ultrasound diagnosis during breast cancer screening. However, the same sensing mechanism, similar configuration and sensor array structure can be applied to other applications involving ultrasound tools for medical diagnostics.']	('Peng', 'Yiyan')	IEEE sensors journal	IEEE Sens J	['eng']

Patients with large >5\u2009cm, high-grade resectable soft tissue sarcomas (STS) have the highest risk of distant metastases. Previously we have shown that dendritic cell (DC) based vaccines show consistent immune responses. Methods. This was a Phase I single institution study of neoadjuvant radiation with DC injections on 18 newly diagnosed high-risk STS patients. Neoadjuvant treatment consisted of 50\u2009Gy of external beam radiation (EBRT), given in 25 fractions delivered five days/week, combined with four intratumoral injections of DCs followed by complete resection. The primary endpoint was to establish the immunological response to neoadjuvant therapy and obtain data on its clinical safety and outcomes. Results. There were no unexpected toxicities or serious adverse events. Twelve out of 18 (67%) patients were alive, of which an encouraging 11/18 (61%) were alive with no systemic recurrence over a period of 2-8 years. Favorable immunological responses correlated with clinical responses in some cases. Conclusions. This study provides clinical support to using dendritic cell injections along with radiation in sarcomas, which when used optimally in combination can help clinical outcomes in soft tissue sarcoma.

['Brain metastasis of primary breast cancer (BCBM) has been rising during the last couple of decades. Approximately 25% of the patients with BCBM have a hormone receptor-negative, HER2-positive disease. Given the short life expectancy in patients with BCBM, researchers have tried many new approaches, including cesium-131(131Cs) brachytherapy, radretumab radioimmunotherapy and nanoparticles. Novel biological drug delivery techniques have successfully delivered nanobioconjugates across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). However, nanobioconjugates have significant toxicities and other drawbacks that prevent therapeutic concentrations of the active drug from being delivered to the brain lesions. Radretumab radioimmunotherapy combined with nanotrastruzumab can theoretically overcome this challenge. Radiotherapy can increase the BBB permeability, which can promote the transport and effect of nanotrastuzumab, reduce radretumab radioimmunotherapy dose and target patients with HER2-positive BCBM lesions more specifically. In this article, we propose that nanotrastuzumab in combination with radioimmunotherapy could be a viable treatment option for patients with HER2-positive breast cancer with brain metastasis.']	('Wang', 'Xuefei')	Medical hypotheses	Med.

"[""This study, using ethnographically-based interviews, sought to describe how chronically ill older adults experience a new cancer diagnosis and the effects of this on their interpretations of personal health, aging, and the future. Three semi-structured interviews were conducted with each of the fifteen informants. We asked questions that explored each individual's life history, chronic illness occurrence, and direct experiences with cancer. Interviews were structured to provide social and historical contexts to enhance our understanding of the informants' illness narratives. Interview transcripts were analyzed thematically to describe how individuals described the cancer experience, its meaning, and its consequences. One of the major findings of our study was the role of cancer in disrupting individual biography, an interruption that fragmented time into three distinct segments: the Recalled Past, the Existent Present, and the Imagined Future. We highlight three main themes around the experience of illness-related time: (1) disruption found in individual biographical accounts as a result of fragmented time dimensions; (2) altered projections of a continuous sense of self into the future; and (3) modified treatment decisions resulting from a perceived altered life course and the finitude of advancing age. We further introduce the concept of Anomalous Time as a permutation of time central to individual experiences of cancer. Implications for how older adults understood their cancer and individual reactions relevant to seeking care are discussed.""]"	('Hannum', 'Susan M')	Journal of aging studies	J Aging Stud	['eng']

26878784	2016	10	Treatment with kaempferol suppresses breast cancer cell growth caused by estrogen and triclosan in cellular and xenograft breast cancer models.	['As a phytoestrogen, kaempferol (Kaem) is one of bioflavonoids, which are found in a variety of vegetables including broccoli, tea and tomato. In this study, the antiproliferative effects of Kaem in triclosn (TCS)-induced cell growth were examined in MCF-7 breast cancer cells. TCS promoted the cell viability of MCF-7 cells via estrogen receptor ? (ER?) as did 17?-estradiol (E2), a positive control. On the other hand, Kaem significantly suppressed E2 or TCS-induced cell growth. To elucidate the molecular mechanisms of TCS and Kaem, alterations in the expressions of cell cycle, apoptosis and metastasis-related genes were identified using western blot assay. The treatment of the cells with TCS up-regulated the protein expressions of cyclin D1, cyclin E and cathepsin D, while down-regulated p21 and bax expressions. Kaem reversed TCS-induced gene expressions in an opposite manner. The phosphorylation of IRS-1, AKT, MEK1/2 and ERK was increased by TCS, indicating that TCS induced MCF-7 cell proliferation via nongenomic ER signaling pathway associated with IGF-1R. Kaem presented an antagonistic activity on this signaling by down-regulating the protein expression of pIRS-1, pAkt and pMEK1/2 promoted by E2 or TCS. In an in vivo xenografted mouse model, tumor growth was induced by treatment with E2 or TCS, which was identified in the measurement of tumor volume, hematoxylin and eosin staining, bromodeoxyuridine and immunohistochemistry assay. On the contrary, E2 or TCS-induced breast tumor growth was inhibited by co-treatment with Kaem, which is consistent with in vitro results. Taken together, these results revealed that Kaem has an anticancer effect against procancer activity of E2 or TCS, a xenoestrogen, in breast cancer and may be suggested as a prominent agent to neutralize breast cancer risk caused by TCS.']	('Kim', 'Seung-Hee')	The Journal of nutritional biochemistry	J.

26878783	2016	10	Dietary flaxseed modulates the colonic microenvironment in healthy C57Bl/6 male mice which may alter susceptibility to gut-associated diseases.	['Understanding how dietary components alter the healthy baseline colonic microenvironment is important in determining their roles in influencing gut health and gut-associated diseases. Dietary flaxseed (FS) has demonstrated anti-colon cancer effects in numerous rodent models, however, exacerbated acute colonic mucosal injury and inflammation in a colitis model. This study investigates whether FS alters critical aspects of gut health in healthy unchallenged mice, which may help explain some of the divergent effects observed following different gut-associated disease challenges. Four-week-old C57Bl/6 male mice were fed an AIN-93G basal diet (BD) or an isocaloric BD+10% ground FS diet for 3 weeks. FS enhanced colon goblet cell density, mucus production, MUC2 mRNA expression, and cecal short chain fatty acid levels, indicative of beneficial intestinal barrier integrity responses. Additionally, FS enhanced colonic regenerating islet-derived protein 3 gamma (RegIII?) and reduced MUC1 and resistin-like molecule beta (RELM?) mRNA expression which may indicate altered responses in regulating microbial defense and injury repair responses. FS diet altered the fecal microbial community structure (16S rRNA gene profiling), including a 20-fold increase in Prevotella spp. and a 30-fold reduction in Akkermansia muciniphila abundance. A 10-fold reduction in A. muciniphila abundance by FS was also demonstrated in the colon tissue-associated microbiota (quantitative PCR). Furthermore, fecal branched chain fatty acids were increased by FS, indicative of increased microbial-derived putrefactive compounds. In conclusion, consumption of a FS-supplemented diet alters the baseline colonic microenvironment of healthy mice which may modify subsequent mucosal microbial defense and injury-repair responses leading to altered susceptibility to different gut-associated diseases.']	('Power', 'Krista A')	The Journal of nutritional biochemistry	J.

['Colon cancer ranks third in cancer-related mortalities in the United States. Many studies have investigated factors that contribute to colon cancer in which dietary and environmental factors have been shown to play an integral role in the etiology of this disease. Specifically, human dietary intake of environmental carcinogens such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons has generated interest in looking at how it exerts its effects in gastrointestinal carcinogenesis. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the preventative effects of olive oil on benzo(a)pyrene [B(a)P]-induced colon carcinogenesis in adult Apc(Min) mice. Mice were assigned to a control (n=8) or treatment group (n=8) consisting of 25, 50 and 100-?g B(a)P/kg body weight (bw) dissolved in tricaprylin [B(a)P-only group] or olive oil daily via oral gavage for 60 days. Our studies showed that Apc(Min) mice exposed to B(a)P developed a significantly higher number (P<0.05) of larger dysplastic adenomas compared to those exposed to B(a)P + olive oil. Treatment of mice with B(a)P and olive oil significantly altered (P<0.05) the expression of drug-metabolizing enzymes in both the colon and liver tissues. However, only GST activity was significantly higher (P<0.05) in the liver of mice treated with 50- and 100-?g B(a)P/kg bw + olive oil. Lastly, olive oil promoted rapid detoxification of B(a)P by decreasing its organic metabolite concentrations and also decreasing the extent of DNA damage to colon and liver tissues (P<0.05). These results suggest that olive oil has a protective effect against B(a)P-induced colon tumors.']	('Banks', 'Leah D')	The Journal of nutritional biochemistry	J. Nutr. Biochem.	['eng']
26878777	2016	10	Prevention of arterial thrombosis by nobiletin: in vitro and in vivo studies.	['Nobiletin, a bioactive polymethoxylated flavone isolated from citrus fruits, has been proven to prevent cancer and inflammation. Dietary flavonoids have been shown to reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), and platelet activation plays a crucial role in CVDs. This study investigated the effect of nobiletin on platelet activation in vitro and in vivo. Nobiletin (10-30?M) inhibited collagen- and arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation in washed human platelets, but it did not inhibit platelet aggregation induced by other agonists such as thrombin and 9,11-dideoxy-11?,9?-epoxymethanoprostaglandin. Nobiletin inhibited the phosphorylation of phospholipase PLC?2, protein kinase PKC, Akt and mitogen-activated protein kinase MAPKs in collagen-activated human platelets and markedly reduced intracellular calcium mobilization and hydroxyl radical (OH(·)) formation. Nobiletin did not affect either phorbol-12,13-dibutyrate-stimulated PKC activation or platelet aggregation. In addition, neither SQ22536, an adenylate cyclase inhibitor nor 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one, a guanylate cyclase inhibitor, significantly reversed the nobiletin-mediated inhibition of platelet aggregation. Moreover, nobiletin substantially prolonged the closure time in whole blood according to platelet function analysis and increased the occlusion time of thrombotic platelet plug formation in mice. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that, in addition to being a potential agent for preventing tumor growth and inflammation, nobiletin exhibits potent antiplatelet activity, which initially inhibits the PLC?2/PKC cascade and hydroxyl radical formation, subsequently suppresses the activation of Akt and MAPKs and ultimately inhibits platelet activation. Our study suggests that nobiletin represents a potential therapeutic agent for preventing or treating thromboembolic disorders.']	('Lu', 'Wan-Jung')	The Journal of nutritional biochemistry	J. Nutr.

['The objective of this study was to develop a quantitative image feature model to predict non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) volume shrinkage from pre-treatment CT images. 64 stage II-IIIB NSCLC patients with similar treatments were all imaged using the same CT scanner and protocol. For each patient, the planning gross tumor volume (GTV) was deformed onto the week 6 treatment image, and tumor shrinkage was quantified as the deformed GTV volume divided by the planning GTV volume. Geometric, intensity histogram, absolute gradient image, co-occurrence matrix, and run-length matrix image features were extracted from each planning GTV. Prediction models were generated using principal component regression with simulated annealing subset selection. Performance was quantified using the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and observed tumor shrinkages. Permutation tests were used to validate the results. The optimal prediction model gave a strong correlation between the observed and predicted tumor shrinkages with r=0.81 and MSE=8.60×10(-3). Compared to predictions based on the mean population shrinkage this resulted in a 2.92 fold reduction in MSE. In conclusion, this study indicated that quantitative image features extracted from existing pre-treatment CT images can successfully predict tumor shrinkage and provide additional information for clinical decisions regarding patient risk stratification, treatment, and prognosis.']	('Hunter', 'Luke A')	Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society	Comput Med Imaging Graph	['eng']

['Because of the potential of a new anti-staphylococcal lead compound SK-03-92 as a topical antibiotic, a patch, or an orally active drug, we sought to determine its safety profile and oral bioavailability. SK-03-92 had a high IC50 (125 ?g/ml) in vitro against several mammalian cell lines, and mice injected intraperiteonally at the highest dose did not exhibit gross toxicity (e.g. altered gait, ungroomed, significant weight loss). Single dose (100 ?g/g) pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis with formulated SK-03-92 showed that peak plasma concentration (1.64 ?g/ml) was achieved at 20-30 min. Oral relative bioavailability was 8%, and the drug half-life was 20-30 min, demonstrating that SK-03-92 is likely not a candidate for oral delivery. Five-day and two-week PK analyses demonstrated that SK-03-92 plasma levels were low. Multi-dose analysis showed no gross adverse effects to the mice and a SK-03-92 peak plasma concentration of 2.12 ?g/ml with the presence of significant concentrations of breakdown products 15 min after dosing. SK-03-92 appeared to be very safe based on tissue culture and mouse gross toxicity determinations, but the peak plasma concentration suggests that a pro-drug of SK-03-92 or preparation of analogs of SK-03-92 with greater bioavailability and longer half-lives are warranted.']	('Schwan', 'William R')	Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)	Antibiotics (Basel)	['eng']

['The aim of this work is to improve physical properties and biological activities of the two flavanones hesperetin and naringenin by complexation with ?-cyclodextrin (?-CD) and its methylated derivatives (2,6-di-O-methyl-?-cyclodextrin, DM-?-CD and randomly methylated-?-CD, RAMEB). The free energies of inclusion complexes between hesperetin with cyclodextrins (?-CD and DM-?-CD) were theoretically investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. The free energy values obtained suggested a more stable inclusion complex with DM-?-CD. The vdW force is the main guest-host interaction when hesperetin binds with CDs. The phase solubility diagram showed the formation of a soluble complex of AL type, with higher increase in solubility and stability when hesperetin and naringenin were complexed with RAMEB. Solid complexes were prepared by freeze-drying, and the data from differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) confirmed the formation of inclusion complexes. The data obtained by the dissolution method showed that complexation with RAMEB resulted in a better release of both flavanones to aqueous solution. The flavanones-?-CD/DM-?-CD complexes demonstrated a similar or a slight increase in anti-inflammatory activity and cytotoxicity towards three different cancer cell lines. The overall results suggested that solubilities and bioactivities of both flavanones were increased by complexation with methylated ?-CDs.']	('Sangpheak', 'Waratchada')	Beilstein journal of organic chemistry	Beilstein J Org Chem	['eng']

The diagnosis of systemic sclerosis was determined according to his clinical and medical history, the positivity of anti-Scl 70 antibodies, the nailfold capillaroscopy suggestive of an active scleroderma pattern and the detection of a mild restrictive pulmonary syndrome. The evaluation of the organbased complications excluded a gastroenterological and cardiovascular involvement, while the chest computed tomography (CT) detected multiple small nodules with a mantle distribution and enlarged lymph nodes with no signs of interstitial lung disease and fibrosis.

['Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection causes a progressive depletion of CD4 + T cells. Despite its importance for HIV-1 pathogenesis, the precise mechanisms underlying CD4 + T-cell depletion remain incompletely understood. Here we make the surprising observation that antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) mediates the death of uninfected bystander CD4 + T cells in cultures of HIV-1-infected cells. While HIV-1-infected cells are protected from ADCC by the action of the viral Vpu and Nef proteins, uninfected bystander CD4 + T cells bind gp120 shed from productively infected cells and are efficiently recognized by ADCC-mediating antibodies. Thus, gp120 shedding represents a viral mechanism to divert ADCC responses towards uninfected bystander CD4 + T cells. Importantly, CD4-mimetic molecules redirect ADCC responses from uninfected bystander cells to HIV-1-infected cells; therefore, CD4-mimetic compounds might have therapeutic utility in new strategies aimed at specifically eliminating HIV-1-infected cells.']	('Richard', 'Jonathan')	EBioMedicine	EBioMedicine	['eng']

['The anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusion oncogene is observed in 3%-5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Crizotinib and ceritinib, a next-generation ALK tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) active against crizotinib-refractory patients, are clinically available for the treatment of ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients, and multiple next-generation ALK-TKIs are currently under clinical evaluation. These ALK-TKIs exhibit robust clinical activity in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients; however, the emergence of ALK-TKI resistance restricts the therapeutic effect. To date, various secondary mutations or bypass pathway activation-mediated resistance have been identified, but large parts of the resistance mechanism are yet to be identified. Here, we report the discovery of p-glycoprotein (P-gp/ABCB1) overexpression as a ceritinib resistance mechanism in ALK-rearranged NSCLC patients. P-gp exported ceritinib and its overexpression conferred ceritinib and crizotinib resistance, but not to PF-06463922 or alectinib, which are next-generation ALK inhibitors. Knockdown of ABCB1 or P-gp inhibitors sensitizes the patient-derived cancer cells to ceritinib, in vitro and in vivo. P-gp overexpression was identified in three out of 11 cases with in ALK-rearranged crizotinib or ceritinib resistant NSCLC patients.

"[""Tumor cell metabolism is altered during leukemogenesis. Cells performing oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) through mitochondrial activity. To limit the deleterious effects of excess ROS, certain gene promoters contain antioxidant response elements (ARE), e.g. the genes NQO-1 and HO-1. ROS induces conformational changes in KEAP1 and releases NRF2, which activates AREs. We show in vitro and in vivo that OXPHOS induces, both in primary leukemic cells and cell lines, de novo expression of NQO-1 and HO-1 and also the MAPK ERK5 and decreases KEAP1 mRNA. ERK5 activates the transcription factor MEF2, which binds to the promoter of the miR-23a-27a-24-2 cluster. Newly generated miR-23a destabilizes KEAP1 mRNA by binding to its 3'UTR. Lower KEAP1 levels increase the basal expression of the NRF2-dependent genes NQO-1 and HO-1. Hence, leukemic cells performing OXPHOS, independently of de novo ROS production, generate an antioxidant response to protect themselves from ROS.""]"	('Khan', 'Abrar Ul Haq')	EBioMedicine	EBioMedicine	['eng']

['The sigma-2 receptor (S2R) is a potential therapeutic target for cancer and neuronal diseases. However, the identity of the S2R has remained a matter of debate. Historically, the S2R has been defined as (1) a binding site with high affinity to 1,3-di-o-tolylguanidine (DTG) and haloperidol but not to the selective sigma-1 receptor ligand (+)-pentazocine, and (2) a protein of 18-21 kDa, as shown by specific photolabeling with [(3)H]-Azido-DTG and [(125)I]-iodoazido-fenpropimorph ([(125)I]-IAF). Recently, the progesterone receptor membrane component 1 (PGRMC1), a 25 kDa protein, was reported to be the S2R (Nature Communications, 2011, 2:380). To confirm this identification, we created PGRMC1 knockout NSC34 cell lines using the CRISPR/Cas9 technology. We found that in NSC34 cells devoid of or overexpressing PGRMC1, the maximum [(3)H]-DTG binding to the S2R (Bmax) as well as the DTG-protectable [(125)I]-IAF photolabeling of the S2R were similar to those of wild-type control cells. Furthermore, the affinities of DTG and haloperidol for PGRMC1 (KI = 472 ?M and 350 ?M, respectively), as determined in competition with [(3)H]-progesterone, were more than 3 orders of magnitude lower than those reported for the S2R (20-80 nM).

['Wnt/?-catenin is involved in every aspect of embryonic development and in the pathogenesis of many human diseases, and is also implicated in organ fibrosis. However, the role of ?-catenin-mediated signaling on liver fibrosis remains unclear. To explore this issue, the effects of PRI-724, a selective inhibitor of the cAMP-response element-binding protein-binding protein (CBP)/?-catenin interaction, on liver fibrosis were examined using carbon tetrachloride (CCl4)- or bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced mouse liver fibrosis models. Following repetitive CCl4 administrations, the nuclear translocation of ?-catenin was observed only in the non-parenchymal cells in the liver. PRI-724 treatment reduced the fibrosis induced by CCl4 or BDL. C-82, an active form of PRI-724, inhibited the activation of isolated primary mouse quiescent hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and promoted cell death in culture-activated HSCs. During the fibrosis resolution period, an increase in F4/80(+) CD11b(+) and Ly6C(low) CD11b(+) macrophages was induced by CCl4 and was sustained for two weeks thereafter, even after having stopped CCl4 treatment. PRI-724 accelerated the resolution of CCl4-induced liver fibrosis, and this was accompanied by increased matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, MMP-2, and MMP-8 expression in intrahepatic leukocytes. In conclusion, targeting the CBP/?-catenin interaction may become a new therapeutic strategy in treating liver fibrosis.']	('Osawa', 'Yosuke')	EBioMedicine	EBioMedicine	['eng']

Inactivation of Tfr1 incapacitated normal energy production in muscle, leading to growth arrest and a muted attempt to switch to fatty acid ? oxidation, using up fat stores. Starvation signals stimulated gluconeogenesis in the liver, but amino acid substrates became limiting and hypoglycemia ensued.

Radiologists' memory was better than novices for images of expertise but no different for everyday scenes. With the heterogeneity of image sets equated, radiologists' expertise with radiographs afforded them better memory for the musculoskeletal radiographs than forest scenes. Enhanced memory for images of expertise disappeared over time, resulting in chance level performance for both image sets after weeks of delay.

26870745	2015	09	Association of computerized texture features on MRI with early treatment response following laser ablation for neuropathic cancer pain: preliminary findings.	"[""Laser interstitial thermal therapy (LITT) has recently emerged as a new treatment modality for cancer pain management that targets the cingulum (pain center in the brain) and has shown promise over radio frequency (RF)-based ablation, due to magnetic resonance image (MRI) guidance that allows for precise ablation. Since laser ablation for pain management is currently exploratory and is only performed at a few centers worldwide, its short- and long-term effects on the cingulum are currently unknown. Traditionally, treatment effects for neurological conditions are evaluated by monitoring changes in intensities and/or volume of the ablation zone on post-treatment Gadolinium-contrast T1-w (Gd-T1) MRI. However, LITT introduces subtle localized changes corresponding to tissues response to treatment, which may not be appreciable on visual inspection of volumetric or intensity changes. Additionally, different MRI protocols [Gd-T1, T2w, gradient echo sequence (GRE), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR)] are known to capture complementary diagnostic information regarding the patient's response to treatment; the utility of these MRI protocols has so far not been investigated to evaluate early and localized response to LITT treatment in the context of neuropathic cancer pain. In this work, we present the first attempt at (a)\xa0examining early treatment-related changes on a per-voxel basis via quantitative comparison of computer-extracted texture descriptors across pre- and post-LITT multiparametric (MP-MRI) (Gd-T1, T2w, GRE, FLAIR), subtle microarchitectural texture changes that may not be appreciable on original MR intensities or volumetric differences, and (b)\xa0investigating the efficacy of different MRI protocols in accurately capturing immediate post-treatment changes reflected (1)\xa0within and (2)\xa0outside the ablation zone. A retrospective cohort of four patient studies comprising pre- and immediate (24\xa0h) post-LITT 3 Tesla Gd-T1, T2w, GRE, and FLAIR acquisitions was considered. Our quantitative approach first involved intensity standardization to allow for grayscale MR intensities acquired pre- and post-LITT to have a fixed tissue-specific meaning within the same imaging protocol, the same body region, and within the same patient. An affine registration was then performed on individual post-LITT MRI protocols to a reference MRI protocol pre-LITT. A total of 78 computerized texture features (co-occurrence matrix homogeneity, neighboring gray-level dependence matrix, Gabor) are then extracted from pre- and post-LITT MP-MRI on a per-voxel basis. Quantitative, voxelwise comparison of the changes in MRI texture features between pre- and post-LITT MRI indicate that (a)\xa0Gabor texture features at specific orientations were highly sensitive as well as specific in predicting subtle microarchitectural changes within and around the ablation zone pre- and post-LITT, (b)\xa0FLAIR was identified as the most sensitive MRI protocol in identifying early treatment changes yielding a normalized percentage change of 360% within the ablation zone relative to its pre-LITT value, and (c)\xa0GRE was identified as the most sensitive MRI protocol in quantifying changes outside the ablation zone post-LITT. Our preliminary results thus indicate potential for noninvasive computerized MP-MRI features over volumetric features in determining localized microarchitectural early focal treatment changes post-LITT for neuropathic cancer pain treatment.""]"	('Tiwari', 'Pallavi')	Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)

['Current computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) models for determining pulmonary nodule malignancy characterize nodule shape, density, and border in computed tomography (CT) data. Analyzing the lung parenchyma surrounding the nodule has been minimally explored. We hypothesize that improved nodule classification is achievable by including features quantified from the surrounding lung tissue. To explore this hypothesis, we have developed expanded quantitative CT feature extraction techniques, including volumetric Laws texture energy measures for the parenchyma and nodule, border descriptors using ray-casting and rubber-band straightening, histogram features characterizing densities, and global lung measurements. Using stepwise forward selection and leave-one-case-out cross-validation, a neural network was used for classification. When applied to 50 nodules (22 malignant and 28 benign) from high-resolution CT scans, 52 features (8 nodule, 39 parenchymal, and 5 global) were statistically significant. Nodule-only features yielded an area under the ROC curve of 0.918 (including nodule size) and 0.872 (excluding nodule size). Performance was improved through inclusion of parenchymal (0.938) and global features (0.932). These results show a trend toward increased performance when the parenchyma is included, coupled with the large number of significant parenchymal features that support our hypothesis: the pulmonary parenchyma is influenced differentially by malignant versus benign nodules, assisting CAD-based nodule characterizations.']	('Dilger', 'Samantha K N')	Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)

The cytotoxicity result indicated that the extract is nontoxic as was clearly substantiated by a half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) value of 59.10\xa0?g/mL. The treated cells (C.\xa0spectabilis extract) demonstrated potassium leakage of 1039 parts per million (ppm) compared to Amphotericin B (AmpB)-treated cells with a released potassium value of 1115\xa0ppm. The effects of the extract on the cell wall proteins illustrated that there were three major types of variations in the expression of treated cell wall proteins: the presence of new proteins, the absence of proteins, and the amount of expressed protein. The activities of two enzymes, ?-glucosidase and proteinase, were determined to be significantly high, thereby not fully coinciding with the properties of the antifungal reaction triggered by C.\xa0spectabilis. The morphology of C.\xa0albicans cells treated with the C.\xa0spectabilis extract showed that the cells had abnormalities and were damaged or detached within the microcolonies. Our study verifies C.\xa0spectabilis leaf extract as an effective anti-C.\xa0albicans agent.']	('Torey', 'Angeline')	Journal of traditional and complementary medicine	J Tradit Complement Med	['eng']
26870685	2016	01	Effect of total hydroalcholic extract of Nigella sativa and its n-hexane and ethyl acetate fractions on ACHN and GP-293 cell lines.	['Medicinal plants are noted for their many advantages including the ability to treat diseases such as cancer. In this study, we examined the antitumor effect of the medicinal plant Nigella sativa on the morphology, survival, and apoptosis of ACHN (human renal adenocarcinoma) and GP-293 (normal renal epithelial) cell lines. From a hydroalcoholic extract of N.\xa0sativa, n-hexane and ethyl acetate fractions were extracted. Cells were treated with various concentrations of total hydroalcholic extract and n-hexane and ethyl acetate fractions; cell viability, morphological changes, and apoptosis were then determined. Results were presented as mean\xa0±\xa0standard error of the mean (SEM). One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was applied for the statistical analysis of the data. The total extract and the fractions in a dose- and time-dependent manner reduced the cell viability in ACHN with no effect on the GP-293 cell line. In addition, the total extract resulted in more morphological changes in the ACHN cells compared to the GP-293 cells. The effect of the total extract in inducing apoptosis after 48 hours in the ACHN cell line was greater than in GP-293. In addition, the effect of the two fractions was lower than the total extract at all used concentrations. Therefore, the effect of total extract and n-hexane and ethyl acetate fractions of N.\xa0sativa on cell viability and apoptosis in the ACHN cell line is greater than in the GP-293 cell line. However, the effect of the total extract is higher than either of the two fractions on their own.']	('Shahraki', 'Samira')	Journal of traditional and complementary medicine	J Tradit Complement Med	['eng']
26870680	2016	02	Antcin K, an active triterpenoid from the fruiting bodies of basswood cultivated Antrodia cinnamomea, induces mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in human hepatoma cells.	['Liver cancer is the second leading cause of cancer deaths in Taiwan as per the 2011 statistics and ranks fourth in cancer-related mortality in the world. Recent researches have shown that Antrodia cinnamomea, a Taiwan-specific medicinal mushroom, has biological activities, including hepatoprotection, anti-inflammation, antihepatitis B virus activity, and anticancer activity. In the present study, the antiproliferative activity and molecular mechanisms of antcin K, the most abundant ergostane triterpenoid from the fruiting bodies of basswood cultivated A.\xa0cinnamomea, were investigated using human hepatoma Hep 3B cells. The results showed that antcin K effectively reduced Hep 3B cells viability within 48 hours. Antcin K induced phosphatidylserine exposure, chromatin condensation, and DNA damage, but did not significantly increase autophagosome content or cause cell expansion and cell lysis. Thus, the principal mode of Hep 3B cells death induced by antcin K was apoptosis, rather than autophagy or necrosis. In-depth investigation of the molecular mechanisms revealed that antcin K first promoted reactive oxygen species generation and adenosine triphosphate depletion, leading to endoplasmic reticulum stress and resulting in mitochondrial membrane permeability changes. After losing the mitochondrial membrane potential, caspase-independent and caspase-dependent apoptosis-related proteins were released, including HtrA2, apoptotic-induced factor, endonuclease G, and cytochrome c. Cytochrome c activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, and cut downstream protein PARP, ultimately leading to cell apoptosis. These results suggested that antcin K induced mitochondrial and endoplasmic reticulum stress-mediated apoptosis in human hepatoma cells. Coupled with these findings, antcin K has a potential to be a complementary agent in liver cancer therapy.']	('Lai', 'Chiao-I')	Journal of traditional and complementary medicine	J Tradit Complement Med	['eng']

This clinical trial study was designated to evaluate the wound healing effect of Dragon's blood on human wounds. Sixty patients, between the ages of 14-65 years, who were referred to remove their skin tag, were assigned to this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial and received either Dragon's blood or a placebo cream. They were visited on the 3rd, 5th, 7th, 10th, 14th, and 20th day of the trial to check the process of healing and to measure the wound's surface. At the end of trial, there was a significant difference in the mean duration of wound healing between the two groups (p\xa0=\xa00.0001). The phenolic compounds and the alkaloid taspine, which exist in Dragon's-blood resin, are probably the main reasons for the wound healing property of this plant. Being natural accessible, safe, and affordable makes Dragon's blood cream, a good choice for addition to the wound healing armamentarium.

['Neurobiological models of obesity postulate that obese individuals have difficulty regulating food intake partly because they attribute excessive salience to stimuli signaling food availability. Typically, human studies that investigate the relationship between brain responses to food-related stimuli and obesity present food cues without subsequent delivery of food. However, in order to identify the brain correlates of cue reactivity, we must record brain responses to food-related cues signaling food availability. Therefore, we have developed a dispensing apparatus for use in a cued-food delivery task in which event-related potentials (ERPs) to food-related images predicting food delivery and images not predicting food delivery can be recorded. Here, we describe a method where:The experimental apparatus dispenses an edible item (i.e., a chocolate candy) which may or may not be eaten, or a non-edible control item (e.g., a plastic bead).Deposit boxes are available to store uneaten candies and the non-edible control items.The dispensing mechanism is capable of recording the exact timestamp when each delivery event occurs (e.g., release from the dispenser, arrival in the receptacle, storage in the deposit box).']	('Deweese', 'Menton M')	MethodsX	MethodsX	['eng']

['Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) has an extremely poor prognosis. Median survival for metastatic patients is six to nine months and survivors beyond one year are exceptional. Pancreatic cancer is resistant to conventional chemotherapy\xa0and is often diagnosed at advanced stages.

Pathology of the specimens showed a complete response in both sites of the disease. The patient remains alive four years from the initial diagnosis and continues on maintenance immunotherapy. This exceptional response to initial chemo-immunotherapy was followed by a novel and off-protocol approach of low-dose capecitabine and IMM-101 as a maintenance strategy.

['Atypical chronic myeloid leukemia (aCML) and chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) are rare hematologic neoplasms characterized by leukocytosis and a hypercellular bone marrow. Although recurrent mutations in the colony-stimulating factor 3 receptor (CSF3R) are frequently observed in patients with (CNL), the mutational landscape in (aCML) is less well-defined. In this report, we describe an 81-year-old male who was diagnosed with aCML. He presented with leukocytosis and anemia but no significant clinical symptoms. Standard laboratory studies revealed the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome. Massively parallel sequencing demonstrated no mutations in CSF3R, but the presence of a heterozygous NRAS-G12D variant (47% allele frequency). The patient was started on treatment with trametinib, an MEK1/2 inhibitor with Food and Drug Administration approval for malignant melanoma. Therapy with trametinib resulted in exceptional improvements in his blood counts and continued disease control with 14 months of follow-up.

Although screening tests have improved the survival rate in malignancies such as colon, breast, cervical and prostate cancer, there is currently no effective screening method available for the early detection of pancreatic cancer. As the sensitivity and specificity of existing biomarkers, such as carbohydrate antigen 19-9, for the early detection of pancreatic cancer is low, there is a pressing need for the identification of novel cancer markers. An increase in erythropoietin (EPO) levels has been observed in several cases of pancreatic neoplasms.

We performed a retrospective analysis of 407 clinical cases, including 77 patients with HPC who received immunotherapy with DC vaccine and CIK cells (I group) and 330 patients with similar characteristics who underwent baseline treatment but did not receive immunotherapy [non-immunotherapy (NI) group)] as the control group. After a follow-up period of 294±207.5 days, the median survival time (MST) of the two groups was compared using the Kaplan-Meier method. In the I group, 61% of the patients developed a positive, delayed-type hypersensitivity response and 65% of the patients exhibited an improvement in QOL. The most notable adverse events included fever (28%), insomnia (25%), anorexia (17%), skin rash (12%) and arthralgia (31%). No severe toxicities were observed in patients in the I group; in addition, the MST was significantly longer in the I group compared with that in the NI group (P=0.014). Thus, the DC vaccine and CIK cell therapy was associated with mild adverse effects, but was able to induce an immune response and effectively eliminate tumor cells, thereby improving the QOL and prolonging the MST of the patients.']	('Zhang', 'Lihong')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

['Phenotyping non-small-cell lung cancer is becoming increasingly important with the advent of molecular testing. Tumours harbouring somatic mutations in the gene that encodes for the tyrosine kinase domain of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) have been found to increase responsiveness to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Endobronchial ultrasound-guided transbronchial needle aspiration (EBUS-TBNA) is a minimally invasive technique for mediastinal node sampling. The available prospective data on EBUS-TBNA sample suitability for molecular profiling are currently limited. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate the adequacy of EBUS-TBNA samples for EGFR and anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) genetic mutation analysis in confirmed primary lung adenocarcinomas. We conducted a prospective analysis of 410 consecutive patients referred for EBUS-TBNA between 2010 and 2014. Rapid on-site cytological evaluation was not used. The samples were obtained using 21-gauge (21G) or 22G needles and were prepared as histopathological samples. A total of 91 samples were confirmed as lung adenocarcinomas and 80 of these samples were sent for EGFR mutation analysis. EBUS-TBNA had a diagnostic accuracy of 98.3% for malignancy. EGFR mutation testing was possible in 79/80 cases (98.75%). EGFR mutations were detected in 5/80 (6.3%) samples. ALK gene analysis, which became available during the study period, was requested and successfully performed in 21/21 samples (100%). The total combined genotyping success rate was 100/101 (99.0%).

A total of 7 studies, including 538 patients, were subjected to the final analysis. Our results indicated that a positive CD133 expression was significantly associated with lymph node metastasis [odds ratio (OR)=3.09, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.93-4.95; P<0.00001], clinical stage (OR=4.26, 95% CI: 1.55-11.73; P=0.005) and histopathological grade (OR=2.40, 95% CI: 1.16-4.94; P=0.02). There was no statistically significant association of CD133 with depth of invasion (OR=1.89, 95% CI: 0.42-8.43; P=0.41).

A single-institution retrospective analysis was performed, including 71 MPN patients diagnosed at the Hakodate Municipal Hospital between April, 2001 and April, 2014, and certain clinical characteristics were identified as effective prognostic factors. The patients were categorized by risk factor scoring based on age, number of abnormal blood cell lineages and splenomegaly at diagnosis, and the association between this categorization and prognosis was analyzed using a statistical procedure. The effect of Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation on prognosis was also investigated. The MPN patients were consolidated into three risk groups based on the margin of intergroup survival differences: i) Score 1-2 (n=23), ii) score 3 (n=24) and iii) score 4-5 (n=24). MPN patients with scores of 4 or 5 exhibited poorer overall survival (OS) compared with those with lower scores (P<0.001). In addition, there were significant differences in event-free survival (EFS) among scoring groups (P=0.0059). PV and ET had a better prognosis compared with PMF, although this analysis suggested that PV and ET patients with scores of 4 or 5 may have a poorer prognosis in terms of OS (P=0.0052) and EFS (P=0.022) and should be closely followed up. We observed no significant prognostic effect of the JAK2V167F mutation for OS (P=0.28) or EFS (P=0.17).

"[""The CXCL10/CXCR3 axis of inflammatory mediators is one of the most important groups of chemokine axes, which has been proven to be a lymphocyte-associated metastasis mediator in several tumors. The term inflammatory adhesions refers to tumors found to be attached to the surrouding tissues during surgery, although no cancer cell infiltration is later identified on pathological examination. The aim of the present study was to investigate the clinical characteristics of stage II colorectal cancer (CRC) and determine the correlation between the CXCL10/CXCR3 axis, inflammatory adhesions and prognosis. Clinicohistopathological data were collected from 401 CRC patients who had undergone R0 resection. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 17.0 software. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was applied to measure the expression of CXCL10 and CXCR3 in 71 recurrent CRC patients, 72 non-recurrent CRC patients and 10 samples from normal peritumoral tissues, all retrieved from the Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital, Tianjin, China. Inflammatory adhesions, tumor location and size and the number of high-risk factors for reccurrence were more significantly associated with overall survival (OS) rather than disease-free survival in all the patients as determined by the log-rank and Cox's regression hazard analysis. Further analysis demonstrated that only the presence of inflammatory adhesions (P=0.025) was associated with the OS of recurrent patients. Patients with recurrence exhibited higher CXCR3 (P<0.001) and CXCL10 (P<0.001) expression compared with non-recurrent patients, as determined by IHC. The correlation between clinicopathological variables, CXCL10/CXCR3 expression and survival was also analyzed: Inflammatory adhesions and general tumor type (ulcerated vs. elevated) exhibited a significant correlation with CXCR3; however, the expression of CXCL10 was not significantly correlated with tumor location, histological type, size, gender, or preoperative carcinoembryonic antigen and hemoglobin levels. Furthermore, patients exhibiting a high expression of CXCR3 presented with a higher risk of relapse; among those, patients with inflammatory adhesions always exhibited worse survival.

26870350	2016	10	Expression of zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox factor 1 in epithelial ovarian cancer: A clinicopathological analysis of 238 patients.	['A growing body of evidence indicates that aberrant activation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) plays a key role in tumor cell invasion and metastasis. Zinc finger E-box-binding homeobox factor 1 (ZEB1), as a crucial mediator of EMT, contributes to the malignant progression of various epithelial tumors. To determine whether ZEB1 is involved in the progression of ovarian cancer, we immunohistochemically evaluated the expression of ZEB1 in 238 cases of epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) and analyzed its associations with clinicopathological parameters. Positive expression of ZEB1 was observed in 32.8% (78/238) of EOCs and it was found to be significantly associated with advanced tumor stage (P=0.001). The survival analysis indicated that the expression of ZEB1 was associated with a poor 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) (P=0.021). A similar tendency was also observed between the expression of ZEB1 and 5-year overall survival, although it did not reach statistical significance (P=0.118). Moreover, the multivariate analysis demonstrated that ZEB1 expression was an independent risk factor for 5-year PFS in ovarian cancer. Taken together, our data provide evidence that ZEB1 may play a crucial role in promoting aggressive ovarian carcinoma progression. Therefore, ZEB1 may serve as an effectively predictive marker and a potential target for therapeutic intervention in EOC.']	('Li', 'Xiufang')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']
26870349	2016	10	Impact of single-nucleotide polymorphisms on radiation pneumonitis in cancer patients.	"[""Radiation pneumonitis (RP) is one of the most important dose-limiting toxicities in the radiotherapy of thoracic tumors, which reduces the rate of local tumor control and overall survival and severely affects the patients' quality of life. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have recently attracted increasing attention as biomarkers for predicting the development of RP. SNPs in inflammation-related, DNA repair-related, stress response-related and angiogenesis-related genes were proved to be associated with RP, with different underlying mechanisms. Radiogenomics focuses on the differences in radiosensitivity caused by gene sequence variation, which may prove helpful in investigating the abovementioned associations. In this review, we aimed to investigate the associations between RP and SNPs reported in recent studies and highlight the main content and prospects of radiogenomics.""]"	('Guo', 'Cheng-Xian')	Molecular and clinical oncology	Mol Clin Oncol	['eng']

However, metabolomic data do not include the absolute concentrations of each metabolite. Generally, mass spectrometry analyses provide metabolite concentrations that are derived from mass peak intensities, and the peak intensities are strictly dependent on the type of mass spectrometer used, as well as the technical characteristics, options and protocols applied. To convert mass peak intensities to actual concentrations, calibration curves have to be generated for each metabolite, and this represents a significant challenge depending on the number of metabolites that are detected and involved in metabolome-based diagnostics. To overcome this limitation, and to facilitate the development of diagnostic tests based on metabolomics, mass peak intensities may be expressed in quintiles. The present study demonstrates the advantage of this approach. The examples of diagnostic signatures, which were designed in accordance to this approach, are provided for lung and prostate cancer (leading causes of mortality due to cancer in developed countries) and impaired glucose tolerance (which precedes type 2 diabetes, the most common endocrinology disease worldwide).']	('Lokhov', 'Petr G')	Biomedical reports	Biomed Rep	['eng']

Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into 3 groups: Sham (control), I/R and V-PYRRO/NO + I/R groups. The liver was subjected to 1 h of partial hepatic ischemia followed by 5 h of reperfusion, saline or V-PYRRO/NO (1.06 µmol/kg/h) administered intravenously. The mRNA expression levels of LTC4S in rat liver tissue were examined by the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction method, the protein expression levels of nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) p65, p50 and I?B? in liver cell lysates and nuclear extracts were detected by western blot analysis. Hepatic mRNA expression of LTC4S was lower in V-PYRRO/NO + I/R group compared to the I/R group. In addition, the protein expression levels of NF-?B p65 and p50 in the nucleus extract were lower in the V-PYRRO/NO + I/R group when compared with the I/R group. However, the I?B? protein in the 3 groups was not changed. Immunohistochemistry staining revealed that the I/R liver exhibited strong cytoplasmic and nuclear staining for NF-?B p65; however, the V-PYRRO/NO + I/R group liver presented slight cytoplasmic and nuclear staining. In conclusion, V-PYRRO/NO may downregulate LTC4S mRNA expression by inhibiting NF-?B activation independent of I?B? during hepatic I/R injury.']	('Hong', 'Feng-Fang')	Biomedical reports	Biomed Rep	['eng']

['Clinically, hepatotoxicity is an inevitable side effect during long-term endocrinotherapy in breast cancer patients. Various studies have reported the specific mechanism and protective methods for this long-term hepatotoxicity, however, the short-term influences of tamoxifen (TAM) on hepatocytes remain to be elucidated. The previous study investigated TAM-induced liver injury at the early stage of endocrine treatment. Mice were assigned into 2 groups: The experiment group was administrated with intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of 6 mg/kg/day TAM for 2 weeks, and the control group was administrated with i.p. injection of physiological saline of the same dose. Body weights in each group were detected every day, and alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels were measured every 3 days. Small pieces of the liver tissues were obtained and processed for protein extraction, biochemical detection and histopathological analysis 2 weeks later. The results indicated that TAM decreased the mice body weights. Morphologically, with the treatment of TAM for only 2 weeks, at the microscopic and ultrastructural levels the structure of hepatic cords became blurred in sections of the regions, although the lobules of the liver remained visible. Partially, hepatic cells were swelled in spherical shapes. Nuclei appeared to be pyknotic and exhibited uneven chromatin distribution. In addition, it was observed in the transmission electron microscopy analysis that nuclei became pyknotic and unevenly distributed. The majority of the nuclei were endowed with distinct heterochromatin and thick nucleoli. The mitochondrial cristae became vague and disorganized. Finally, western blotting was used and detected a significant increase of the caspase-3 level in the liver tissues. In conclusion, the experiments elucidated that TAM (6 mg/kg/day) would cause hepatotoxicity at the early stage of endocrine treatment in mice, and the underlying mechanism was involved with hepatocyte apoptosis.']	('Gao', 'Fang-Fang')	Biomedical reports	Biomed Rep	['eng']

['The leaves of Garcinia celebica strongly inhibit the proliferation of MCF-7 human breast adenocarcinoma cell lines. The present study focused on investigating the active anticancer and antiproliferative compound from the G. celebica leaves and assessing its mechanism of action. Ethanol extracts of G. celebica were fractionated based on their polarity using n-hexane, ethyl acetate and water. The antiproliferative properties were tested in vitro against MCF-7 human breast cancer cell lines using the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazolyl-2)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. The active compound was subsequently isolated using column chromatography and identified by nuclear magnetic resonance. The characterized compound was also tested for its antiproliferative properties and the mechanism by which it induces apoptosis in MCF-7 cells by western blot analysis of the activated apoptotic proteins. This resulted in the isolation of a friedolanostane triterpenoid, which was determined to be methyl-3?, 23-dihydroxy-17,14-friedolanstan-8,14,24-trien-26-oat. This compound inhibited MCF-7 cell proliferation in a time- and dose-dependent manner with IC50 values of 82 and 70 µM for the 24 and 48 h treatments, respectively. Furthermore, the western blot analysis suggested that the compound exerted its anticancer activities by promoting apoptosis through the inhibition of the oncogenic protein Akt, thereby increasing the expression of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) protein. These results suggest that methyl-3?,23-dihydroxy-17,14-friedolanstan-8,14,24-trien-26-oat is the anticancer compound found in G. celebica, providing a basis for its potential use in cancer disease management.']	('Subarnas', 'Anas')	Biomedical reports	Biomed Rep	['eng']

['The effect of mead acid (MA; 5,8,11-eicosatrienoic acid) on the suppression of the development and growth of N-methyl-N-nitrosourea (MNU)-induced mammary cancer in female Sprague-Dawley rats was examined. The MA diet (2.4% MA) or control (CTR) diet (0% MA) was started at 6 weeks of age, MNU was injected intraperitoneally at 7 weeks of age, and the rats were maintained on the respective diets for the whole experimental period (until 19 weeks of age). All induced mammary tumors were luminal A subtype carcinomas (estrogen and progesterone receptor positive and HER2/neu negative). The MA diet significantly suppressed the initiation and promotion phases of mammary carcinogenesis; MA suppressed the development (incidence, 61.5 vs. 100%; multiplicity, 2.1 vs. 4.5) and the growth (final tumor weight, 427.1 vs. 1,796.3 mg) of mammary cancers by suppressing cell proliferation, but not by accelerating cell death. There were evident changes in the major fatty acid composition of n-3, n-6, and n-9 fatty acids in the serum of the MA diet group; there was a significant increase in MA and significant decreases in oleic acid (OA), linoleic acid, arachidonic acid and docosahexaenoic acid. In non-tumorous mammary tissue, there was a significant increase in MA and a significant decrease in OA in the MA diet group. The n-6/n-3 ratios in serum and mammary tissue of the MA diet group were significantly decreased. The MA diet suppressed MNU-induced luminal A mammary cancer by lowering cancer cell proliferation. Therefore, MA may be a chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agent. In addition to hormone therapy, MA supplementation may be a beneficial chemotherapeutic agent for the luminal A subtype of breast cancer.']	('Kinoshita', 'Yuichi')	Biomedical reports	Biomed Rep	['eng']

['The morbidity associated with cancer has rapidly increased in recent years, and in the previous 5 years has had a tendency to be the leading cause of fatality compared with cardiovascular disease. Therefore, effective measures are required with an aim to reduce the incidence. Based on the results of clinical investigation, a multidisciplinary treatment strategy for cancer, which includes radiotherapy, chemotherapy, surgery, targeted therapy and immunotherapy, are prominently used in clinical practice. However, the therapies are insufficient due to multidrug resistance, adverse effects and the presence of the root of the cancer. Therefore, there is a necessity to develop more effective or adjunctive therapies for cancer prevention and treatment. Cancer is now widely recognized as a systemic humoral disease. Similarly, the function of herbal drugs is to modulate the whole body system in a more holistic way. Recently, herbal drugs have been applied to one of the efficient approaches for cancer therapy. Furthermore, there is evidence that various herbal medicines have been proven to be useful and effective in sensitizing the conventional agents against the various factors at the cellular and molecular levels that are associated with the occurrence of cancer and in prolonging survival time, alleviating side effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and improving the quality of life in cancer patients.']	('Nie', 'Jiao')	Biomedical reports	Biomed Rep	['eng']

Clinical factors, including age, gender, type of malignancy, level of obstruction, cause of obstruction, pre-operative creatinine level, degree of hydronephrosis, condition of the contralateral ureter, prior radiotherapy, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status (ECOG PS), bladder wall invasion and technical failure, were recorded for each case. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to investigate the risk factors for predicting the failure of retrograde ureteral stent insertion. In total, 38 out of 164 patients experienced bilateral obstruction, therefore, a total of 202 ureteral units were available for data analysis. The rate of insertion failure in MUO was 34.65%. Multivariate analyses identified ECOG PS, degree of hydronephrosis and bladder wall invasion as independent predictors for insertion failure. Overall, the present study found that rate of retrograde ureteral stent insertion failure is high in outpatients with MUO, and that ECOG PS, degree of hydronephrosis and bladder invasion are potential independent predictors of insertion failure.']	('Wang', 'Jin-You')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870298	2016	11	Truncated neurokinin-1 receptor is an ubiquitous antitumor target in hepatoblastoma, and its expression is independent of tumor biology and stage.	['The substance P (SP; also known as TAC1)/neurokinin-1 receptor (NK1R; also known as TACR1) complex is a critical part in the development of cancer. Therefore, NK1R antagonists, such as the clinical drug aprepitant, are currently under investigation as future anticancer agents. In a previous study, NK1R (TACR1) was identified as a potent anticancer target in hepatoblastoma (HB). However, little is known regarding the exact distribution of this target among HB subsets and whether it correlates with clinical features and prognosis. In the present study, mRNA was isolated from 47 children with HB, and reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction was performed on the samples to analyze the expression of full-length-TACR1 (fl-TACR1) and truncated-TACR1 (tr-TACR1). These data were correlated with data obtained from 9 tumor-free controls, as well as with the presence of metastasis, PRETEXT, vascular invasion, histology, age of diagnosis, multifocality, CTNNB1 mutation, gender and overall survival. Additionally, the present study investigated a recently described 16-gene signature characterizing HB known to correlate with prognosis. Compared with tumor-free liver tissue, tumorous tissue expressed TACR1 significantly higher for the truncated version (P=0.0301), and by trend also for the full-length version. Accordingly, the expression of fl-TACR1 correlated with the expression of the truncated version (P=0.0074). Furthermore, a low expression of fl-TACR1 correlated with characteristics of the 16-gene signature known to predict prognosis (P=0.0222). However, there was no correlation between tr-TACR1 and the tumor characteristics investigated, including outcome, although a clear trend was observed for some tumor characteristics. The current results reinforced the previously described findings that in HB, tr-TACR1 is overexpressed compared with tumor-free liver tissue. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, the present study demonstrated for the first time that tr-TACR1 is expressed ubiquitously among the different subsets of HB. Therefore, NK1R may serve as a potent anticancer target in a large variety of patients with HB, independent of tumor biology and clinical stage.']	('Garnier', 'Agnès')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

The GATA4 and GATA5 expression levels and gene promoter methylation of HCC tissue samples from 38 patients and HCC cell lines were analyzed using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and methylation-specific PCR (MSP), respectively. The effects of GATA4 and GATA5 overexpression on the proliferation and colony forming ability of HCC cells were also assessed using cell viability and colony formation assays. A luciferase reporter assay was utilized to investigate the transcriptional interaction of GATA4 and GATA5 with canonical Wnt signaling. The results indicated that the expression levels of GATA4 and GATA5 were lost or reduced following methylation of gene promoters in HCC tissues and cell lines. Treatment with a demethylating agent, 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine (5-AZA), restored GATA4 and GATA5 expression in HCC cell lines. Furthermore, methylation of the GATA5 promoter was observed to be associated with the age of patients exhibiting HCC. Restoration of GATA4 and GATA5 expression inhibited colony formation and induced apoptosis of HCC cells in vitro.

A retrospective analysis oF 81 patients with esophageal cancer was conducted. According to the location of the lesions, the lymph drainage area was delineated and the dosimetric parameters were calculated. The 1-, 3-, 5- and 8-year survival rates of the patients were 67.90, 33.33, 20.99 and 11.11%, respectively. Based on the dose-volume histogram in the treatment plan, we calculated the volume percentage of the planning target volume including clinically positive lymph nodes (PTV-N) receiving radiation doses of 30, 35, 40, 45 and 50 Gy (VPTV-N30-50). The median values of VPTV-N30-50 were 73, 70, 67, 64 and 58%, respectively. The prescribed dose size exhibited no correlation with VPTV-N30-35, but did exhibit a significant correlation with VPTV-N40-50; the radiation field was not correlated with VPTV-N30-45, but exhibited a significant correlation with VPTV-N50; The length of the lesion on esophageal barium meal X-ray and the PTV were significantly correlated with VPTV-N30-50. The analysis of variance revealed that the VPTV-NX value in the upper thoracic segment was higher compared with that in the middle and lower thoracic segments; VPTV-N30-35 values differed significantly according to the different locations of the lesions, whereas VPTV-N40-50 values exhibited no significant differences. The value of VPTV-NX exerted no significant effect on long-term patient survival. Therefore, the corresponding lymph drainage area of esophageal cancer IS subjected to a certain Radiation dose when patients undergo 3D-CRT with IFI, which may play a role in the prevention of regional nodal metastasis.

"[""The vimentin gene is a hallmark of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and has been observed to be overexpressed in various types of tumor cell line and tissue. Previous studies have reported correlations between vimentin DNA methylation levels and subsequent vimentin expression levels in solid tumors, including breast and colorectal cancer; however, to the best of our knowledge, such a correlation has not been reported for gastric cancer (GC) using Lauren classification. Therefore, the present study aimed to quantify DNA methylation levels of the vimentin gene using quantitative (q) methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in intestinal-type GC cell lines (MKN-28, AGS and MKN-1), diffuse-type GC cell lines (SGC-7901, SNU-5 and KATO III), the GES-1 immortalized human non-neoplastic gastric epithelial cell line, as well as in tumor and paratumor normal tissue samples. Furthermore, the present study analyzed the messenger RNA expression of the vimentin gene in these cell lines and tissues by reverse transcription-qPCR. A comparison of the clinicopathological features was conducted between patients, grouped according to the Lauren classification. The present study identified that the vimentin promoter region was hypermethylated in all GC cell lines and tumor tissue samples when compared with immortalized normal gastric epithelial cells and paratumor normal tissues. In addition, vimentin promoter methylation levels were observed to be higher in intestinal-type cell lines when compared with those of diffuse-type lines and tissues. Correspondingly, vimentin expression levels were lower in intestinal-type gastric cell lines compared with those of diffuse-type cell lines and tissues, and were lowest in the non-neoplastic gastric cell line and paratumor normal tissues. Patients with diffuse-type GC were on average younger (P=0.023), and exhibited higher tumor (P=0.020), node (P=0.032) and TNM classification of malignant tumor stage (P=0.039) than those with intestinal-type GC. Following treatment of AGS cells (which demonstrated the highest methylation level of the vimentin gene) with 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine, vimentin expression was restored significantly. Thus, the present study revealed that vimentin promoter methylation levels are inversely correlated with vimentin expression levels in GC (according to Lauren classification). High levels of methylation in the vimentin gene promoter region may be involved in carcinogenesis and the development of GC, and may provide a novel molecular classification for GC.""]"	('Cong', 'Hui')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

The present study performed an observational retrospective analysis in Area Vasta Romagna, Italy, collecting information on tumour marker determination in 760 consecutive patients who started a new line of anticancer therapy between January and June 2010. The determination of well-known biomarkers was requested for all gastrointestinal stromal tumour (GIST) patients (n=13) and for almost all breast cancer patients (n=369), and targeted therapies were consequently prescribed. Conversely, Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) determination in colon cancer patients (n=177) was requested in ~50% of advanced cases, while epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) determination was required in slightly more than 30% of the same patients. EGFR and KRAS determinations were requested in only 15% and 7.5% of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients (n=201), respectively. There would appear to be greater appropriateness of tumour marker determination for breast cancer and GISTs than for colon cancer and NSCLC. Resources can be further optimised by standardising tumour marker determinations in terms of the timing of requests and the consequent use of the results for tailored treatment planning.']	('Massa', 'Ilaria')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

The aim of the current study was to evaluate the potential prognostic significance of serum osteoprotegerin (OPG), p53 protein and urine telomerase in patients with bladder cancer. For all patients, serum levels of OPG and p53 protein were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and urine telomerase was assessed using a polymerase chain reaction ELISA technique. Patients were assigned into group 1 (cystectomy and adjuvant radiotherapy) or group 2 (transurethral resection and chemoradiotherapy). The results revealed that serum OPG and p53, and urine telomerase levels were significantly higher in bladder cancer patients compared with in healthy individuals (P<0.0001). High serum OPG was associated with significantly lower overall survival and disease-free survival rates (both P=0.001), and was correlated with advanced tumor stages (P<0.0001), high tumor grades (P<0.0001) and the occurrence of disease relapse (P=0.001).

Future trials are required to elucidate its therapeutic role in such patients.']	('Bakry', 'Rania')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870290	2016	11	Mangiferin inhibition of proliferation and induction of apoptosis in human prostate cancer cells is correlated with downregulation of B-cell lymphoma-2 and upregulation of microRNA-182.	['Mangiferin, a flavonoid extracted from the mango tree, possesses anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, anti-herpes simplex and antitumor activity, and is able to affect immune function. The present study investigated the anticancer effects of mangiferin treatment on PC3 human prostate cancer cells, and the potential underlying mechanisms. In the present study, an MTT assay was used to analyze the proliferation of PC3 cells. Subsequently, flow cytometry and colorimetric assay kits were utilized to measure the PC3 cell apoptotic rate. The expression levels of B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2) and microRNA-182 (miR-182) were detected using western blot analysis and quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. Finally, miR-182 and anti-miR-182 were transfected into PC3 cells, which were used to investigate the effects of mangiferin. Mangiferin treatment reduced the proliferation of PC3 human prostate cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. In addition, mangiferin was able to promote apoptosis and induce the caspase-3 activity of PC3 human prostate cancer cells. Mangiferin treatment was also able to significantly reduce Bcl-2 expression levels and enhance miR-182 expression in PC3 cells. Finally, it was observed that mangiferin inhibited proliferation and induced apoptosis in PC3 human prostate cancer cells, and this effect was correlated with downregulation of Bcl-2 and upregulation of miR-182.']	('Li', 'Minglin')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['The cancer-testis (CT) family of antigens are expressed in multiple types of malignant neoplasm and are silent in normal tissues, apart from the testis. Immunotherapy targeting CT antigens is a promising therapeutic strategy for treatment of solid tumors. One member of this family, melanoma-associated antigen A4 (MAGE-A4), has been demonstrated to be expressed in melanomas and lung cancer. Patients with tumors expressing the MAGE-A4 antigen exhibit specific cellular and humoral immune responses to the antigen, resulting in a favorable prognosis. Conversely, the expression of MAGE-A4 is associated with poor survival in lung cancer. Myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) are a heterogeneous population of immunosuppressive cells, which are upregulated in the cancer microenvironment. Little is known regarding any potential correlation between the expression of MAGE-A4 antigens and the accumulation of MDSCs. The present study aimed to examine the association between circulating MDSC levels and MAGE-A4 expression in a mouse model of Lewis lung cancer. The expression of MAGE-A4 in tumor cells or tissues was evaluated using western blotting, while the percentage of MDSCs (CD11b+Gr-1+) in the blood was detected by flow cytometry. In addition, the suppressive capacity of MDSCs and the effectiveness of MDSC depletion were assessed in C57BL/6 tumor-bearing mice. MDSCs were demonstrated to upregulate MAGE-A4 expression via the phosphosphorylated-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3705 pathway, while depletion of MDSCs decreased the tumor growth rate, prolonged median survival and enhanced the recognition of MAGE-A4 by CD8+ T cells. These findings indicated that immunotherapeutic strategies involving induction of cytotoxic T lymphocytes that target MAGE-A4, in combination with MDSC depletion, may be an effective approach to immunotherapy for cancer types with high expression of MAGE-A4.']	('Shi', 'Guilan')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is responsible for the highest number of cancer-associated mortalities worldwide, and the five-year survival rate is <15% following the initial diagnosis. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve important functions in a number of human diseases, including cancer. The present study investigated the expression status, clinical relevance and functional role of miRNA in NSCLC. miRNA expression profiling was performed in lung adenocarcinoma and adjacent unaffected lung tissues using 47 groups of fresh-frozen (FF) and 45 of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) samples from 11 pulmonary bulla. miR-21, -30e, -363 and -623 were further examined for differential expression in two independent cohorts. Other miRNAs, including miR-5100 and miR-650, were upregulated, while miR-10a and -26b were downregulated in FF NSCLC tissues. The associations between these miRNAs and their clinicopathological features were also investigated. miR-363, -10a and -145 were associated with lymph node status (P=0.002, 0.005 and 0.007, respectively) and miR-650 and -145 were associated with differentiation (P=0.01 and 0.05, respectively). No associations were identified for the other miRNAs examined. In the FFPE NSCLC samples, miR-30e-5p correlated with the differentiation of the tissue (P=0.011). The present study indicates that these miRNAs may be appropriate candidates for molecular diagnostic and prognostic markers in NSCLC.']	('Wang', 'Yahong')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

The absorption spectrum of DTP was analyzed using a microplate spectrophotometer. The HGC27 or SNU-1 cells were incubated with DTP and exposed to illumination by a 650-nm laser. The experiments were divided into four groups: A blank control, cells treated with DTP without light, cells exposed to laser light without DTP and cells treated with a combination of DTP and light together. The phototoxicity of DTP was analyzed by 3-(4,5-dimethyl-2-thiazolyl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide assay. Cell apoptosis was detected by flow cytometry and Hoechst 33342 staining. In addition, the intracellular distribution of DTP was investigated by laser scanning confocal microscopy. DTP-PDT demonstrated marked phototoxicity towards HGC27- and SNU-1 cells. The rate of cell death increased significantly in a DTP concentration-dependent and light dose-dependent manner, with maximum mortality rates of 74.14 and 67.76%, respectively. There were significant differences between the therapeutic and control groups (P<0.01). In addition, the growth of cells treated with DTP or laser light alone was not inhibited. Further evaluation revealed that, following DTP-PDT, HGC27 and SNU-1 cells demonstrated notable apoptotic changes, including condensed chromatin, fragmented nuclei and apoptotic bodies, and the percentage of apoptotic cells was significantly higher than that of the control groups (P<0.01). Furthermore, confocal laser scanning microscopy revealed that DTP localized to the lysosomes but not mitochondria in the two types of tumor cell. In conclusion, significant phototoxicity and reduced cytotoxicity in dark conditions make the novel photosensitizer DTP a promising potential PDT drug for future use in the treatment of human gastric cancer.']	('Chen', 'Jing-Jing')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Myeloid tumor possessing platelet-derived growth factor receptor ? (PDGFR?) gene rearrangement is a rare hematological malignancy, which presents with typical characteristics of myeloid proliferation disorders and eosinophilia. In the present study, an elderly chronic myelomonocytic leukemia patient was diagnosed with chromosome rearrangement. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was conducted with a PDGFR? isolate probe, and gene translocation between PDGFR? on chromosome 5 and genes on the chromosomes of group D (13-15) was detected. Karyotype analysis revealed a chromosome 5 break, and PDGFR?-thyroid hormone receptor interactor 11 (CEV14) gene fusion was confirmed via reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which additionally revealed the chromosome rearrangement t(5;14)(q33;q32). Due to the correlation between PDGFR?-CEV14 expression and effectiveness of treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors, this fusion gene is considered to be an oncogene. In the present study, an elderly patient was diagnosed with a myeloid tumor associated with the fusion gene PDGFR?-CEV14, using the methods of FISH and RT-PCR. These methods were confirmed to be of significant value in improving diagnosis, guiding treatment and increasing the cure rate of patients, due to their ability to detect multiple rearrangement genes associated with PDGFR? in myelodysplastic and myeloproliferative neoplasms.']	('Gong', 'Sheng-Lan')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Extramedullary plasmacytoma (EMP) is a rare malignant tumor that is characterized by a malignant plasma cell neoplasm. Such neoplasms in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients are extremely rare. To the best of our knowledge, the present study describes the first case of a solitary adrenal EMP in a patient with HIV. A 35-year-old male who had been diagnosed with HIV 3 months previously presented with a 2-week history of intermittent right flank pain. Abdominal computed tomography revealed a soft-tissue density mass in the right adrenal gland area. The patient subsequently underwent a retroperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Post-operative pathological diagnosis revealed a solitary EMP. Although the patient refused to undergo post-operative radiotherapy and chemotherapy, no recurrence was detected after 2 years of follow-up. The present case illustrates the fact that this rare type of solitary EMP associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) can occur in the adrenal glands, and that retroperitoneal laparoscopic resection of the tumor may be a good method to manage this condition. In addition, although rare, solitary EMP should be considered in the differential diagnosis of an adrenal mass in HIV-infected patients.']	('Cao', 'Dehong')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870280	2016	11	Activating transcription factor 2 expression mediates cell proliferation and is associated with poor prognosis in human non-small cell lung carcinoma.	['Activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) is a member of the cAMP response element binding protein family that heterodimerizes and activates other transcription factors involved in stress and DNA damage responses, growth, differentiation and apoptosis. ATF2 has been investigated as a potential carcinogenic biomarker in certain types of cancer, such as melanoma. However, its function and clinical significance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has not been well studied. Therefore, the present study aimed to analyze the association between ATF2/phosphorylated (p)-ATF2 expression and NSCLC malignant behavior, and discuss its clinical significance. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and western blotting were used to detect the expression of ATF2 in NSCLC cell lines and fresh NSCLC tissue samples. In addition, immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed to identify the location and expression of ATF2 and p-ATF2 (threonine 71) in paraffin-embedded sections of NSCLC and adjacent normal tissue. The results demonstrated that ATF2 was markedly overexpressed in the NSCLC cells and significantly overexpressed in the fresh NSCLC tissues compared with the control cells and samples (86 paraffin-embedded tissue sections), respectively (P<0.01). Further data demonstrated that ATF2 expression levels were significantly increased in tumor tissues compared to normal tissues and ATF2 was located in the cytoplasm and nucleus. ATF2 expression was closely associated with adverse clinical characteristics such as TNM stage (P=0.002), tumor size (P=0.018) and metastasis (P=0.027). In addition, nuclear p-ATF2 staining was positive in 65/86 samples of NSCLC. Furthermore, the Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with high levels of ATF2 and p-ATF2 expression had a significantly shorter overall survival compared with patients exhibiting a low expression (P<0.01 and P<0.05, respectively). Subsequent in vitro experiments revealed that cell growth decreased following knockdown of ATF2 expression using RNA interference, indicating that ATF2 may suppress cell proliferation. Taken together, the results of the present study demonstrated that ATF2 and p-ATF2 were significantly overexpressed in NSCLC tissues, and ATF2 and p-ATF2 overexpression predicted significantly worse outcomes for patients with NSCLC.']	('You', 'Zhenyu')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) has been implicated in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) in numerous types of cancer. However, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no previous evidence that HGF has a role in prostate cancer. The present study aimed to investigate the effect of HGF on EMT and invasive potential, as well as the underlying molecular mechanisms, in a human prostate cancer cell line. Therefore, PC-3 cells were treated with various concentrations of HGF for varying durations. EMT-associated proteins, including E-cadherin and vimentin, were examined by western blot analysis. The effects of HGF on cell proliferation, migration, invasion and tumorigenicity were assessed using MTT, wound-healing, Transwell and soft-agar assays. Subsequently, the role of c-Met in the mediation of EMT-like changes was investigated using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, western blot analysis and gene knockdown by small interfering RNA. Finally, western blot analysis was used to quantify the expression of a downstream transcription factor and extracellular signal-related kinase/mitogen activated protein kinase (ERK/MAPK) signaling pathway proteins. The results indicated that treatment with HGF induced EMT-like changes and enhanced the invasive potential of PC-3 cells. There was an increase in the expression of ERK, phosphorylated-ERK and zinc finger E-box binding homeobox-1 (Zeb-1), suggesting that EMT-like changes may be mediated through the ERK/MAPK and Zeb-1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, HGF-mediated EMT-like changes were associated with c-Met activation, and these changes were able to be blocked by c-Met knockdown. The present study demonstrated that HGF-induced EMT increased the invasive potential of PC-3 human prostate cancer cells through activating the ERK/MAPK and Zeb-1 signaling pathway.']	('Han', 'Yili')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

"[""Esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) is the eighth most frequent neoplasm in China. However, the expression levels of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1) in patients with ESCC remain to be determined. In the present study, 829 ESCC cases were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The association between the expression levels of HER2 and MRP1 and the patient's clinicopathological factors was analyzed using Fisher's exact test or ?2 test. Univariate analysis was performed via Kaplan-Meier survival curves, while the Cox proportional hazard model was used for multivariate analysis. A significant correlation was observed between the expression levels of HER2 and the patient's gender (P<0.050), tumor size (P=0.013) and venous/lymphatic invasion (P=0.039). However, no significant correlation was identified between the expression levels of MRP1 and the clinicopathological factors of the patients. In univariate analysis, gender, differentiation, depth of invasion, clinical stage, adjuvant radiotherapy or chemotherapy and lymph node metastasis were significantly correlated with progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with ESCC (P<0.050). The graphical representation of the Kaplan-Meier estimate curves suggested that the expression levels of HER2 or MRP1 did not exert any influence on prognosis (log-rank test, P>0.050). In multivariate analysis, tumor location, gender, clinical stage, differentiation and lymph node metastasis were identified as independent factors of prognosis in patients with ESCC (P<0.050). However, the expression levels of HER2 or MRP1 were not independently associated with PFS or OS in these patients. In conclusion, the present large-scale study demonstrates that the protein expression levels of HER2 and MRP1 does not exert any influence on the prognosis of ESCC.""]"	('Chen', 'Yong')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['?-fetoprotein (AFP)-producing colorectal adenocarcinoma is rare and typically not well recognized. In the present study, 3 cases of AFP-producing colorectal cancer are described. All 3 of these cases demonstrated increased levels of blood AFP associated with disease progression. Only case 2 exhibited classical histological hepatoid features. Following immunohistochemical tissue staining, all 3 cases were observed to be positive for AFP expression. In addition, the expression of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), c-Met receptor and the transcription factor c-Myc were identified to be associated with the expression of AFP. The 3 cases demonstrated resistance to multiple drugs, including epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors, despite the presence of wild-type Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (K-RAS; codons 12 and 13), neuroblastoma-RAS (codons 12 and 13) and B-Raf proto-oncogene, serine/threonine kinase (V600E). We propose that hepatoid histological features or a positive AFP finding by immunohistochemistry are sufficient for a diagnosis of AFP-producing colorectal adenocarcinoma. Furthermore, we speculates that autocrine HGF/c-Met activation may be capable of inducing the dedifferentiation of common adenocarcinoma cells, reverting them to a cancer stem cell state and producing AFP or hepatoid differentiation. Consequently, therapy targeted to the HGF/c-Met signaling pathway may potentially be effective for the treatment of AFP-producing colorectal adenocarcinoma.']	('Li', 'Jun')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

The present study aimed to explore the prognostic implications of survivin and lung resistance protein (LRP) in advanced NSCLC treated with platinum-based chemotherapy. Tumor samples were collected from 61 hospitalized patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC that underwent platinum-based chemotherapy. All patient samples were collected in the Oncology Department of the Third Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University between January 2006 and January 2011. Cytoplasmic survivin and LRP expression were evaluated using immunohistochemistry. The expression of LRP and survivin reached 77% (47/61) and 76% (45/61), respectively. Positive expression of survivin was associated with a lower median progression-free survival (PFS) time (4 vs. 9 months; P=0.038) and a lower median overall survival (OS) time compared with the absence of survivin expression (9 vs. 16 months; P=0.039). Patients with LRP and survivin expression (n=41) demonstrated a median PFS time of 4 months. However, patients with either LRP or survivin expression (n=10) demonstrated a median PFS time of 8 months, which is similar to the median PFS time of the 10 patients with no expression of LRP and survivin (9 months; P=0.022).

However, low or nearly undetectable levels of PSA in the modern era of ultrasensitive PSA assay may be difficult to interpret in patients with a history of prostate cancer. Deciding whether to initiate additional systemic therapy in limited indolent metastatic disease while balancing the quality of life of the patient and ensuring the oncologic control of the disease may be challenging. In the present study, the case of a biopsy-confirmed solitary spine recurrence of prostate cancer with nearly undetectable but persistent levels of PSA (0.05 ng/ml) is reported. Treatment of the recurrence with local ablative radiotherapy improved the pain experienced by the patient, and reduced his levels of PSA to undetectable limits (<0.05 ng/ml). Repeated imaging analysis, PSA assay and clinical assessment demonstrated durable control of the disease without the requirement for additional systemic treatments. The present case highlighted the importance of initiating appropriate work-up according to the clinical scenario.

The DNA methylation status, mutations, copy number gains, protein expression of representative genes, and the sensitivity to several drugs were examined in these 4 cell lines. Methylation of P16 was demonstrated in 3/4 cell lines, in which the protein expression of p16 was lost. Methylation of RASSF1A was observed in 3/4 cell lines. Copy number gains of EGFR, HER2 or MET were not detected in the 4 cell lines. Mutations in various genes, including EGFR, KRAS, HER2, BRAF, and PIK3CA, which are frequently detected in non-small cell lung cancer, were not detected in the 4 cell lines. microRNA-34b/c is a direct transcriptional target of p53 and is often silenced in MPM by promoter methylation.

The present study was conducted to investigate the expression of COX-2 and IL-32 in primary gastric B-cell lymphoma in order to define their clinical significance and their association with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection. COX-2 and IL-32 protein expression was detected in 31 primary gastric B-cell lymphoma patients and 19 chronic gastritis patients with immunohistochemistry. COX-2 and IL-32 expression was significantly higher in primary gastric lymphoma (PGL) tissues compared with gastritis tissues (51.6 vs. 21.1% for COX-2, P=0.032; and 58.1 vs. 26.3% for IL-32, P=0.029) and was significantly higher in Hp+ lymphoma tissues compared with Hp- lymphoma tissues (66.7 vs. 20% for COX-2, P=0.015; and 71.4 vs. 30% for IL-32, P=0.029). In the PGL tissues, the expression level of COX-2 was positively correlated with the expression level of IL-32, and the two were each positively correlated with Hp infection (P=0.004 for COX-2 and IL-32; P=0.01 for COX-2 and Hp infection; and P=0.003 for IL-32 and Hp infection). COX-2 expression was found to be significantly associated (P<0.05) with an aggressive tumor type, higher expression of Ki-67, frequent lymph node metastasis and advanced stage.

The present study investigated the hypothesis that treatment with baicalein may inhibit the proliferation, motility and invasion of human CRC cell lines via regulation of the protein kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway. Baicalein was demonstrated to significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of CRC cells (P=0.01). Additionally, after treatment with baicalein for 24 h, the protein expression levels of matrix metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9 in CRC cells were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner (P=0.01). Furthermore, treatment with baicalein significantly reduced the expression levels of phosphorylated AKT (P=0.01).

Despite nicotine being a major component of cigarette smoke, it is not carcinogenic when acting alone. Instead, it is believed to function as a tumor promoter. Due to the fatal consequences of lung cancer being primarily associated with the processes of invasion and metastasis, the present study aimed to determine the effect of nicotine on the migratory activity of lung cancer cells. The effect of nicotine on the migration of lung cancer A549 cells was evaluated by a wound healing assay. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) was used as a pro-migratory stimulus. During several of the experiments, specific inhibitors of ?7-nicotine acetylcholine receptor (?7-nAchR), phosphoinositide kinase-3 (PI3K) and extracellular signal-related kinase (ERK)1/2 were included. The phosphorylation levels of Akt and ERK1/2 were examined using a cell-based protein phosphorylation assay. It was observed that nicotine did not induce cell migration by itself, but that it instead promoted HGF-induced cell migration. The effects of nicotine were inhibited by the pretreatment of the cells with the ?7-nAchR inhibitor, methyllycaconitine, and the PI3K inhibitor, LY294002. The mitogen-activated protein kinase/ERK kinase kinase inhibitor exerted modest, but non-significant inhibitory activity on the effect of nicotine. Nicotine did not induce Akt phosphorylation by itself, but instead promoted the HGF-induced phosphorylation of Akt. It was also observed that nicotine had no effect on ERK1/2 phosphorylation. The results from the present study indicate that nicotine, when alone, does not have a pro-migratory function, but instead enhances responsiveness to the pro-migratory stimulus emitted by HGF. The current study provides an insight into the mechanism of tumor promotion by demonstrating that nicotine and ?7-nAchRs act in synergy with the HGF-induced PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, increasing the sensitivity of lung cancer cells to HGF, and thereby promoting cell migration, a vital step in invasion and metastasis.']	('Yoneyama', 'Remi')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870264	2016	11	Sigmoid colonic metastasis by lymphatic spread occurring with unilateral Krukenberg tumor considered to be caused by stage IA early gastric cancer: A case report.	['Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies in Asia, and the second most common cause of cancer-associated mortality in Japan. Colorectal metastases originating from gastric adenocarcinoma are extremely rare. The present study reports an unusual case of lymphogenous sigmoid metastasis of gastric adenocarcinoma occurring in a 58-year-old female patient. Endoscopic and radiological findings were indicative of 0-IIc+IIa early gastric cancer, and radical distal gastrectomy with D2 lymph node dissection was performed. The pathological diagnosis was stage IA gastric adenocarcinoma (T1bN0M0), according to the Japanese classification of gastric cancer. A follow-up examination at 18 months post surgery revealed a recurrence of paraaortic lymph node metastasis, detected by abdominal computed tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET)/CT. The patient received chemotherapy with S-1 and cisplatin. Subsequently, radiotherapy was administered to the paraaortic lymph nodes at levels Th11-L3. Follow-up abdominal CT and PET/CT revealed an enlarged left ovary, and abnormal uptake in the left ovary and sigmoid colon. An oophorectomy and sigmoidectomy with D3 lymph node dissection were performed. The pathological diagnosis was metastatic adenocarcinoma; this was identical to the gastric pathology in the previous pathological report. The patient continued treatment with chemotherapy. Although sigmoid colonic metastasis from gastric cancer is extremely rare, metastasis from gastric cancer must be considered during the differential diagnosis of cases involving a colorectal mass and a previous history of gastric cancer.']	('Fujimoto', 'Daisuke')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

The present study conducted a systematic review of the literature in order to identify pathological hypotheses, clinical characteristics, and diagnostic and treatment options. A search for relevant studies was conducted through the Scopus, Embase and Medline databases during September 2014. The search term employed was ?epidermal inclusion cyst breast?. Studies were selected if they contained adequate information regarding symptoms at presentation, diagnostic tools, pathology, characteristics, type of procedure performed and follow-up routines. A total of 35 papers describing 91 patients affected by EIC of the breast were identified. Following this, a total of 82 patients, including an additional case supplied from the present study, were selected for further analysis. EIC of the breast typically occurs during the fifth decade of life. A palpable mass of the breast was present in 65 (79%) patients. Ultrasonographic imaging was consistently utilized as a diagnostic tool in all the cases analyzed, whereas fine-needle aspiration cytology was used in 70% of the cases and mammography in 65%. No tumor recurrence was reported at a mean follow-up time of 53 months. The present study demonstrated that elliptical excision is the preferred treatment for EIC of the breast, with pathological analysis required to exclude malignancy.']	('Paliotta', 'Annalisa')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870259	2016	11	Effects of plant-derived anti-leukemic drugs on individualized leukemic cell population profiles in Egyptian patients.	['Leukemias are a group of cancer types that originate from blood-forming tissues. In this disease, an abnormally large number of immature white blood cells is produced by the bone marrow. The relationship between treatments with plant-derived drugs and leukemia-associated immunophenotypes (LAIPs) of clinically isolated leukemia cells has yet to be established. The aim of the present study was to develop a preliminary clinical prognostic map for commonly expressed LAIPs in patients clinically diagnosed with leukemia, as well as to assess the potential involvement of LAIPs in the response rate to 10 natural products of plant origin. An increased expression of LAIPs, including CD4, CD14, CD33 and CD34, was considered a surrogate marker of the desired response of leukemia cells to treatment with plant-derived drugs. By contrast, the increased expression of the LAIPs, MPO and DR, was associated with poor prognostic outcomes following treatment with the plant-derived drugs. The results showed that 5 of the 10 plant-derived drugs tested induced the expression of several desirable LAIPs biomarkers. These findings clearly highlight the potential treatment efficacy of certain plant-derived drugs against leukemic cell types.']	('Aboul-Soud', 'Mourad A M')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870258	2016	11	Globular adiponectin enhances invasion in human breast cancer cells.	['Every year, a large number of women succumb to metastatic breast cancer due to a lack of curative approaches for this disease. Adiponectin (AdipoQ) is the most abundant of the adipocyte-secreted adipokines. In recent years, there has been an interest in the use of AdipoQ and AdipoQ receptor agonists as therapeutic agents for the treatment of breast cancer. However, while multiple epidemiological studies have previously indicated that low levels of circulating plasma AdipoQ portend poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer, recent studies have reported that elevated expression levels of AdipoQ in breast tissue are correlated with advanced stages of the disease. Thus, the aim of the present study was to clarify the mechanism by which AdipoQ in breast tissue acts directly on tumor cells to regulate the early steps of breast cancer metastasis. In the present study, the effects of different AdipoQ isoforms on the metastatic potential of human breast cancer cells were investigated. The results revealed that globular adiponectin (gAd) promoted invasive cell morphology and significantly increased the migration and invasion abilities of breast cancer cells, whereas full-length adiponectin (fAd) had no effect on these cells. Additionally, gAd, but not fAd, increased the expression levels of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 beta (LC3B)-II and intracellular LC3B puncta, which are indicators of autophagosome formation, thus suggesting autophagic induction by gAd. Furthermore, the inhibition of autophagic function by autophagy-related protein 7 knockdown attenuated the gAd-induced increase in invasiveness in breast cancer cells. Therefore, the results of the present study suggested that a specific AdipoQ isoform may enhance breast cancer invasion, possibly via autophagic induction. Understanding the roles of the different AdipoQ isoforms as microenvironmental regulatory molecules may aid the development of effective AdipoQ-based treatments for breast cancer.']	('Falk Libby', 'Emily')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Previous studies have indicated that complex interactions among viral, environmental and genetic factors lead to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To identify susceptibility alleles for hepatitis B virus (HBV)-related HCC, the present study conducted a pilot two-phase genome-wide association study (GWAS) in 660 Han Chinese individuals. In phase 1, a total of 500,447 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped in 50 HCC cases and 50 controls using Affymetrix GeneChip 500k Array Set. In phase 2, 1,152 SNPs were selected from phase 1 and genotyped in 282 cases and 278 controls using the Illumina GoldenGate platform. The prior probability of HCC in control subjects was assigned at 0.01, and false-positive report probability (FPRP) was utilized to evaluate the statistical significance. In phase 1, one SNP (rs2212522) showed a significant association with HCC (Pallele=5.23×10-8; ORallele=4.96; 95% CI, 2.72-9.03). In phase 2, among 27 SNPs with unadjusted Pallele<0.05, 9 SNPs were associated with HCC based on FPRP criteria (FPRP <0.20). The strongest statistical evidence for an association signal was with rs2120243 (combined ORallele=1.76; 95% CI, 1.39-2.22; P=2.00×10-6), which maps within the fourth intron of VEPH1. The second strongest statistical evidence for an association was identified for rs1350171 (combined ORallele=1.66; 95% CI, 1.33-2.07; P=6.48×10-6), which maps to the region downstream of the FZD4 gene. The other potential susceptibility genes included PCDH9, PRMT6, LHX1, KIF2B and L3MBTL4. In conclusion, this pilot two-phase GWAS provides the evidence for the existence of common susceptibility loci for HCC. These genes involved various signaling pathways, including those associated with transforming growth factor ?, insulin/phosphoinositide 3 kinase, Wnt and epidermal growth factor receptor. These associations must be replicated and validated in larger studies.']	('Qu', 'Li-Shuai')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870256	2016	11	Novel method for the detection and quantification of malignant cells in the CSF of patients with leptomeningeal metastasis of lung cancer.	['The aim of the present study was to discuss a novel method for the detection of malignant tumor cells in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), by observing tumor marker-immunostaining fluorescence in situ hybridization (TM-iFISH) enrichment and by counting CSF malignant tumor cells in patients with lung cancer leptomeningeal metastasis (LM). A total of 10 CSF samples were collected from 6 patients that presented with lung cancer LM. For each patient, 20 ml CSF was obtained through a lumbar puncture, of which 7.5 ml was used to count the number of malignant tumor cells in the CSF using TM-iFISH enrichment. Cytological and biochemical examinations were conducted on the remaining 10 ml and 2.5 ml CSF, respectively. The 10 CSF samples were successfully analyzed by TM-iFISH, and the tumor cell count range was 3-1,823 cells/7.5 ml CSF in 7 of the samples detected. There were no tumor cells detected in the remaining 3 samples. Tumor cells were revealed in 3 of the samples through the CSF cytological examinations, and albumin protein levels were indicated to be greater than the normal range (normal range, 0.15-0.45 g/l), in 9 of the samples using CSF biochemical examinations. Additionally, TM-iFISH was performed again to count the CSF malignant tumor cells in 3 of the patients following intrathecal injection of chemotherapy (methotrexate 10 mg and dexamethasone 5 mg). The results indicated that the malignant tumor cell count of 2 of the patients had decreased in comparison to the pre-treatment cell count. As it is capable of enriching and counting CSF malignant tumor cells in patients with lung cancer LM, TM-iFISH may be an effective method to diagnose lung cancer LM and to evaluate its efficacy.']	('Ma', 'Chunhua')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

"[""In 2013, a 76-year-old male with a cardiac pacemaker was diagnosed with adenosquamous carcinoma of the duodenum. Subsequently, a pancreatoduodenectomy and lymph node dissection were performed, and 12 cycles of adjuvant chemotherapy (modified FOLFOX6 regimen), which consisted of fluorouracil, leucovorin and oxaliplatin, were administered via a central venous catheter. At 5 months after the completion of adjuvant chemotherapy, the patient experienced the sudden onset of severe pain at the back right of the ear, edema of the right side of the face and right jugular vein dilatation. Computed tomography (CT) revealed filling defects in the superior vena cava (SVC) and right brachiocephalic vein, indicating catheter-induced venous thrombosis. Although the catheter was removed and anti-coagulation therapy, aspiration of the thrombosis and ballooning dilatation were performed immediately, the patient's symptoms were not ameliorated. Notably, histological examination following thrombus aspiration revealed metastatic cancer cells, and fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography/CT identified metabolically active nodules in the SVC at locations consistent with the initial duodenal tumors detected by CT and in the first thoracic vertebrae. The tumor thrombus rapidly increased in size and resulted in worsening dyspnea. Subsequently, radiotherapy was performed, followed by chemotherapy, which relieved the systemic symptoms and suppressed the tumor growth. Adenosquamous carcinoma of the duodenum is extremely rare, and to the best of our knowledge, intraluminal SVC metastasis as a result of adenosquamous carcinoma of the duodenum has not been reported previously. The placement of a cardiac pacemaker, central venous catheter and tumor cells possessing high metastatic potential are hypothesized to have contributed to this rare case of metastasis.""]"	('Takayoshi', 'Kotoe')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870253	2016	11	Sentinel lymph node biopsy in T1/T2 squamous cell carcinomas of the tongue: A prospective study.	['Commonly used staging procedures often cannot predict the absence of cervical metastases (CM) in squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs) of the oral cavity. Due to the high incidence of occult CM in numerous N0 cases in the clinic, an elective neck dissection (ND) is performed. The sentinel lymph node biopsy (SNB) is a common concept in the modern surgical therapy of malignancies. The present study evaluates the applicability of this concept for T1/T2-SCC of the tongue. In a prospective clinical study, 10 consecutive patients with T1/T2-SCC of the tongue and cN0 necks, were enrolled. Following sentinel lymph node (SLN) scintigraphy, all patients underwent SNB with a ?-probe and a subsequent ND. SNB specimens were compared with histopathological assessments of surgical specimens from the ND. A total of 5 female and 5 male patients (mean age, 52 years; women, 62 years; men, 42 years), with a median follow-up time of 33.5 months (range, 10-40 months), were treated. All patients presented with detectable SLNs. In 7 cases, the SLN(s) and the residual ND were negative for CM. In 3 cases, the SLN(s) were positive without further CM in the other neck nodes. Furthermore, 1 patient showed additional CMs after 10 months in the contralateral neck and lung metastasis after 18 months, but none at the time of the initial treatment. The concept of an SNB appears to be applicable to the management of the cN0 neck in small SCC of the tongue. The role of SNB in the management of SCC requires further investigation by prospective trials with larger patient numbers.']	('Sagheb', 'Keyvan')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870251	2016	11	The development of tumours under a ketogenic diet in association with the novel tumour marker TKTL1: A case series in general practice.	"[""Since the initial observations by Warburg in 1924, it has become clear in recent years that tumour cells require a high level of glucose to proliferate. Therefore, a ketogenic diet that provides the body with energy mainly through fat and proteins, but contains a reduced amount of carbohydrates, has become a dietary option for supporting tumour treatment and has exhibited promising results. In the present study, the first case series of such a treatment in general practice is presented, in which 78 patients with tumours were treated within a time window of 10 months. The patients were monitored regarding their levels of transketolase-like-1 (TKTL1), a novel tumour marker associated with aerobic glycolysis of tumour cells, and the patients' degree of adherence to a ketogenic diet. Tumour progression was documented according to oncologists' reports. Tumour status was correlated with TKTL1 expression (Kruskal-Wallis test, P<0.0001), indicating that more progressed and aggressive tumours may require a higher level of aerobic glycolysis. In palliative patients, a clear trend was observed in patients who adhered strictly to a ketogenic diet, with one patient experiencing a stagnation in tumour progression and others an improvement in their condition. The adoption of a ketogenic diet was also observed to affect the levels of TKTL1 in those patients. In conclusion, the results from the present case series in general practice suggest that it may be beneficial to advise tumour patients to adopt a ketogenic diet, and that those who adhere to it may have positive results from this type of diet. Thus, the use of a ketogenic diet as a complementary treatment to tumour therapy must be further studied in rigorously controlled trials.""]"	('Jansen', 'Natalie')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Breast cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer in women and contributes to 32% of all female cancer cases. Cathepsins, a family of proteins, are known to have a critical role in human cancers. However, previous studies on the systematic analysis of the role of cathepsin family members in breast cancer are limited. The aim of the present study was to identify biological markers to predict prognosis and treatment response of breast cancer patients, as well as to elucidate novel therapeutic targets. The present study analyzed the expression of six members of cathepsin family, including cathepsins B, G, D, K, L and V in 188 breast cancer tissue specimens using immunohistochemistry. The data showed that all members of the tested cathepsin families featured cytoplasmic staining. Notably, expression of cathepsin L was associated with advanced tumor stages, while cathepsins B and K expression levels were associated with positive estrogen receptor expression; in addition, cathepsin K expression was also demonstrated to be associated with progesterone receptor expression. Cathepsins V and D expression levels were found to be associated with breast cancer metastasis, while the expression levels of cathepsins B and D were associated with poor disease-free survival in breast cancer patients. In addition, univariate analysis demonstrated that breast cancer metastasis to the bone and the expression of cathepsin B protein were associated with poor disease-free survival. In conclusion, the results of the present study indicated that the altered expression of cathepsins, in particular cathepsins B and D, contributed to the progression of breast cancer and poor disease-free survival in breast cancer patients.']	('Sun', 'Tao')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Subsequent to processing, Fishers exact test and the metaDE package in R language were applied to screen the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between primary and metastatic CRC samples. In addition, function and pathway enrichment analysis was performed using online tools in the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery resource and common DEGs in GSE14297 and GSE49355 were identified. Their expression values in another dataset, GSE29621, were then collected in order to screen the genes with high standard deviations between primary and metastatic samples, which were considered as candidate metastasis-associated genes. Candidate genes were finally verified by performing survival analysis via the log-rank test. A total of 370 DEGs were screened in GSE14297 and GSE49355, and 77 common DEGs were identified. Upregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in the immune, energy metabolism and drug metabolism-associated functions. Downregulated DEGs were mainly enriched in cell adhesion-associated functions. A total of 12 genes, including the carbonic anhydrase II (CA2), carcinoembryonic antigen-related cell adhesion molecule 7 (CEACAM7), Fc fragment of immunoglobulin G binding protein (FCGBP), and placenta-specific 8 (PLAC8), were the candidate metastasis-associated genes, among which FCGBP expression significantly decreased the overall survival time of patients.

The positive expression rate of PTEN in the normal pancreatic tissue was higher than that in pancreatic carcinoma (P<0.05), while the positive expression rate of KAI1 in the normal pancreatic tissue was lower than that in pancreatic carcinoma (P<0.05). Pathological factors such as clinical stage of disease, histological grade and the presence or absence of lymphatic metastasis significantly affected the expression of PTEN and KAI1 (P<0.05).

['Breast cancer 1, early onset (BRCA1)-interacting protein 1 (BRIP1), a DNA-dependent adenosine triphosphatase and DNA helicase, is required for BRCA-associated DNA damage repair functions, and may be associated with the tumorigenesis and aggressiveness of various cancers. The present study investigated the expression of BRIP1 in normal cervix tissues and cervical carcinoma via reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and immunohistochemistry assays. BRIP1 expression was observed to be reduced in squamous cancer tissue and adenocarcinoma compared with normal cervix tissue, and there were significant correlations between the reduction in BRIP1 expression and unfavorable variables, including the International Federation of Gynecologists and Obstetricians stage and presence of lymph node metastases. In order to elucidate the role of BRIP1 in cervical cancer, a BRIP1 recombinant plasmid was constructed and overexpressed in a cervical cancer cell line (HeLa). The ectopic expression of BRIP1 markedly inhibited the tumorigenic properties of HeLa cells in vitro, as demonstrated by decreased cell growth, invasion and adhesion, and increased cell apoptosis. In addition, it was identified that the inhibitory tumorigenic properties of BRIP1 may be partly attributed to the attenuation of RhoA GTPase activity. The present study provides a novel insight into the essential role of BRIP1 in cervical cancer, and suggests that BRIP1 may be a useful therapeutic target for the treatment of this common malignancy.']	('Zou', 'Wei')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that participate in several cellular functions and tumour progression. A previous microarray study demonstrated that miR-135b is downregulated in prostate cancer (PCa) cells, but the role and molecular mechanism of miR-135b in the regulation of tumour metastasis remain to be elucidated. In the present study, significant downregulation of miR-135b in PCa tissues, compared with noncancerous tissues, was detected by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction. Furthermore, the expression of miR-135b was demonstrated to be associated with the pathological stage and the levels of total and free prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in PCa cells. In addition, signal transducer and activator of transcription 6 (STAT6) was identified as a target of miR-135b in PCa cells by luciferase activity and western blot assays. The upregulation of miR-135b in PCa cells led to reduced expression of STAT6 in the cytoplasm and nucleus of these cells, while the overexpression of miR-135b and knockdown of STAT6 were able to inhibit the migration and invasion abilities of PCa cells in vitro.

['The present study aimed to explore the role of integrin ?1 and the relevant signaling pathways in acquired gefitinib resistance in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The inhibitory effects of gefitinib, with or without LY294002, on cellular proliferation were evaluated by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl) 2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell cycle progression and apoptosis were analyzed by flow cytometry, while western blotting was used to evaluate the expression of EGFR, phosphorylated (phospho)-EGFR, protein kinase B (Akt), phospho-Akt, extracellular signal-regulated kinase (Erk) and phospho-Erk. The gene expression profiles of PC9 and PC9/G cells were determined by DNA microarray. Integrin ?1 was knocked down in PC9/G cells by transiently transfected short interfering RNA (siRNA). A scrambled siRNA sequence was used as a control. Apoptosis of transfected cells was determined by Annexin V-phycoerythrin-Cy5/propidium iodide staining. Sequencing products were amplified by nested PCR. The resistant index of PC9/G cells to gefitinib was ~138- to 256-fold higher than that of PC9 cells, and this resistance was accompanied by significant increase in integrin ?1 expression in PC9/G cells. Knockdown of integrin ?1 with short hairpin RNA in PC9/G cells markedly inhibited proliferation and enhanced apoptosis in response to gefitinib, restoring the sensitivity of PC9/G cells gefitinib. Phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt activation was observed in PC9/G cells in the presence of gefitinib and the sensitivity of PC9/G cells to gefitinib was also able to be restored by PI3K/Akt pathway inhibitor LY294002. Finally, knockdown of integrin ?1 significantly reduced the levels of phospho-Akt. These findings suggest that integrin ?1 signaling via the PI3K/Akt pathway may be a significant mechanism underlying gefitinib resistance, and may potentially present an alternative therapeutic target for the treatment of NSCLC unresponsive to EGFR inhibitors.']	('Deng', 'Qin-Fang')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in the GC samples compared with the normal controls. Two-way hierarchical clustering of DEGs was performed to distinguish the normal controls from the GC samples. The co-expression coefficient was analyzed among the DEGs using the data from COXPRESdb. The gene co-expression network was constructed based on the DEGs using Cytoscape software, and modules in the network were analyzed by ClusterOne and Bingo. Furthermore, enrichment analysis of the DEGs in the modules was performed using the Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery. In total, 596 DEGs in the GC samples and 57 co-expression gene pairs were identified. A total of 7 genes were enriched in the same module, for which the function was phosphate transport and which was annotated to participate in the extracellular matrix-receptor interaction pathway. These genes were collagen, type VI, ?3 (COL6A3), COL1A2, COL1A1, COL5A2, thrombospondin 2, COL11A1 and COL5A1. Overall, the present study identified several biomarkers for GC using the gene expression profiling of human GC samples. The COL family is a promising prognostic marker for GC.

HSP and P-glycoprotein (the MDR1 gene product) expression was evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis of paraffin-embedded sections obtained from 37 patients with chondrosarcoma (19 male and 18 female; aged 33-85 years; mean age, 48.5 years). HSP73 and 90 were significantly overexpressed in patients with local recurrence: HSP73 was expressed in 7/7 patients (100%) with local recurrence and 9/18 patients (50%) without recurrence (P<0.02), while HSP90 was expressed in all patients with recurrence but only 8/18 (44%) without recurrence (P<0.02). A marked association was also identified between HSP expression and survival. HSP72 and 73 were significantly overexpressed in tumours from patients who succumbed to the disease (all positive for HSP72 and 73; P<0.05). No differences were observed between HSP27, 73 or 90-positive or -negative tumours according to age or gender. In addition, HSP72 expression was correlated with differentiation of the tumours (P<0.02). These results indicate that HSP72, 73 and 90 may function as novel prognostic markers for chondrosarcoma, and initiate further studies regarding the use of such markers for the identification of patients with poor prognosis.']	('Trieb', 'Klemens')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870240	2016	10	Immunosuppression of breast cancer cells mediated by transforming growth factor-? in exosomes from cancer cells.	['Exosomes derived from tumor cells are essential for processes involved in tumor progression, including angiogenesis, tumor cell proliferation and immunoregulation. In addition, exosome secretion may contribute to the mechanisms of hypoxia-induced angiogenesis and metastasis of tumors. In the present study, as it is one of the most common cancers in females, breast cancer, cell lines were cultured under hypoxic (1% O2) and normoxic conditions to evaluate the effects of hypoxia on exosome production. Under hypoxic conditions an increase in the number of exosomes in the medium, determined by CD63 immunoblotting, was observed. Application of these exosomes to T cells revealed that they were able to suppress T cell proliferation. As transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?), interleukin-10, and prostaglandin E2 are important factors in the mediation of T cell suppression, the exosomes were subsequently treated with antibodies against these three factors. The results revealed that anti-TGF-? was capable of ameliorating the immunosuppressive effects of exosomes. These data demonstrate that hypoxia enhances the secretion of exosomes by breast cancer cells, which acts to suppress T cell proliferation via TGF-?. The findings have significant implications for understanding the underlying mechanisms of immunosuppression in tumor microenvironments, and for the potential development of cancer therapies.']	('Rong', 'Lei')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870238	2016	11	Resveratrol suppresses human glioblastoma cell migration and invasion via activation of RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.	['Numerous studies have demonstrated that resveratrol has a potential use in cancer prevention and treatment. However, the effects of resveratrol on cancer cell motility and invasiveness remain unclear. The current study aimed to examine the effects of resveratrol on cell migration and invasion in human glioblastoma cells, and to explore the underlying molecular mechanisms. In wound-healing and Matrigel transwell assays, resveratrol was found to significantly inhibit the migration and invasion of U87MG, T98G and U251 glioblastoma cells in vitro. Results from western blot analysis and gelatin zymography revealed that resveratrol also suppressed the expression and activity of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2; P<0.05), an important mediator of cell migration and invasion. Furthermore, using a pull-down assay, increased activation of RhoA was observed in glioblastoma cells treated with resveratrol vs. controls (P<0.05). Notably, inhibition of the RhoA/Rho-associated kinase (ROCK) pathway by C3 transferase or Y-27362 was found to attenuate the resveratrol-induced reductions in cell migration and invasion (P<0.05), and also partially rescued the decreased expression and activity of MMP-2 induced by resveratrol (P<0.05). Taken together, the results suggest that resveratrol may inhibit glioblastoma cell motility and invasiveness via activating the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway.']	('Xiong', 'Wei')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870236	2016	11	The effects of buthionine sulfoximine on the proliferation and apoptosis of biliary tract cancer cells induced by cisplatin and gemcitabine.	"[""Patients with biliary tract cancer (BTC) have a poor prognosis. Advanced BTC patients have been treated with cisplatin in combination with gemcitabine, however, the treatment has had little impact on survival rates, and more effective treatments are urgently required for this disease. Previous studies discovered that buthionine sulfoximine (BSO), a potent inhibitor of glutathione (GSH) synthesis, was able to enhance the cytotoxic effect of various drugs in cancer cells. Phase I studies demonstrated that continuous-infusion of BSO was relatively non-toxic and resulted in the depletion of tumor GSH. However, the synergistic effect of BSO and cisplatin in BTC cells remains unknown, and no reports are available regarding sensitization to gemcitabine by BSO. In the present study, the effect of BSO in combination with cisplatin or gemcitabine in the treatment of BTC cells was examined in vitro. Cytotoxic effects were measured using an MTT assay, Annexin V assay and fluorescence-activated cell sorting analysis. Antiapoptotic protein expression levels were examined using western blot analysis. The results revealed that a sub-toxic concentration of BSO was capable of significantly enhancing cisplatin-induced apoptosis in BTC cells. The mechanisms of BSO's effect on BTC cells may be attributable to the reduction of GSH levels and downregulation of the expression of antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-xL and Mcl-1). Furthermore, BSO enhanced the antiproliferative effect of gemcitabine. In conclusion, the present data are the first results to indicate that BSO may sensitize BTC cells to standard first-line chemotherapeutic agents (cisplatin and gemcitabine). Combining BSO with cisplatin and gemcitabine is a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of BTC.""]"	('Li', 'Qiwei')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte activation and extension of the cell life span is necessary in order to enable immunotherapy to perform effectively against cancer. In the present study, mucin 1 (MUC1)-stimulated human mononuclear cells (M1SHMCs) were costimulated with bead-attached monoclonal antibodies specific for cluster of differentiation (CD)3 and CD28 receptors. The study was undertaken to determine whether costimulation was capable of enhancing the killing of cancer cells in vitro and of protecting non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice from tumor development. Lysis of MCF-7 tumor cells by M1SHMCs was reduced following costimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28. Furthermore, costimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 eliminated the protective effects of M1SHMCs on MCF-7 breast cancer cell growth in the non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient mice. The present study suggested that costimulation with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 is not advisable following antigen activation of lymphocytes under the conditions used here. Using a lower anti-CD3/CD28 bead to T-cell ratio may prevent immune suppression, however, further studies are required to support this hypothesis.']	('Wright', 'Stephen E')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870232	2016	11	Helicobacter pylori-infected MSCs acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype and induce human gastric cancer migration by promoting EMT in gastric cancer cells.	['Accumulating clinical and experimental evidence has suggested that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection-associated gastric cancer (GC) is associated with high rates of mortality and serious health effects. The majority of patients succumb to H. pylori infection-associated GC due to metastasis. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), which have multipotent differentiation potential, may be recruited into the tumor-associated stroma. MSCs are crucial components of the H. pylori infection-associated GC microenvironment, and may be critical for GC cell migration. In this study, an MSCs/H. pylori co-culture model was designed, and the effect of H. pylori-infected MSCs on the migration of GC cells was evaluated using a Transwell migration assay. H. pylori-infected MSC cytokine expression was evaluated using Luminex/ELISA. The expression of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) markers in the GC cells treated with supernatants from H. pylori-infected MSCs were detected by western blot analysis. The results demonstrated that the interaction between MSCs and H. pylori may induce GC cell migration, through secretion of a combination of cytokines that promote EMT in GC cells. The expression of phosphorylated forms of nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) was observed to be increased in MSCs by H. pylori. Inhibition of NF-?B activation by pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate blocked the effects of H. pylori-infected MSCs on SGC-7901 human stomach adenocarcinoma cell migration. Overall, the results of the present study suggest that H. pylori-infected MSCs acquire a pro-inflammatory phenotype through secretion of a combination of multiple cytokines, a number of which are NF-?B-dependent. These cytokines enhance H. pylori infection-associated GC cell migration by promoting EMT in GC cells. The results of the present study provide novel evidence for the modulatory effect of MSCs in the tumor microenvironment and provide insight into the significance of stromal cell involvement in GC progression.']	('Zhang', 'Qiang')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['The present study aimed to determine the expression of stem cell markers Nanog compared with PSCA in gastric cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues, and to investigate the association between tumor stem cells and initiation, progression, metastasis, and prognosis of gastric cancer. One hundred chemotherapy- and radiotherapy-naive patients with pathologically confirmed gastric cancer were enrolled from the General Surgery Department and Surgical Oncology Department of the Affiliated Hospital of Inner Mongolia Medical University (Hohhot, P.R. China), between October 2011 and June 2013. Surgically resected specimens of cancer tissues and adjacent normal tissues (>5 cm from the boundary of cancerous component) were collected. The mRNA expression levels of Nanog and PSCA in those tissues was determined by reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). The correlation between the expression of stem cell markers Nanog and PSCA in gastric cancer tissues and clinicopathological factors was analyzed. The qPCR results demonstrated that the relative expression of Nanog was increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with in the adjacent tissues (P<0.05); and relative expression of PSCA was reduced in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent tissues (P<0.05). The expression of Nanog and PSCA in gastric cancer tissues was associated with tumor differentiation. The expression of Nanog was increased in poorly-differentiated and undifferentiated tumors compared with moderately- and well-differentiated tumors (P<0.05). The expression of PSCA was reduced in poorly differentiated and undifferentiated tumors compared with moderately- and well-differentiated tumors (P<0.05). However, the expression of Nanog and PSCA was not associated with age, gender, tumor size, TNM stage, depth of invasion, or lymph node metastasis. Therefore, Nanog and PSCA may have potential as molecular markers to reflect the differentiation status of gastric cancer.']	('Zhao', 'Xuanzhong')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of non-coding RNAs 18-25 nucleotides in length, which play important roles in the regulation of cancer progression through gene silencing. miRNA (miR)-101 has been suggested to be associated with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the detailed role of miR-101 in HCC metastasis and the underlying mechanism remain largely unclear. The present study demonstrated that the expression of miR-101 was significantly reduced in HCC tissues compared with that in matched normal adjacent tissues. miR-101 was also found to be downregulated in four HCC cell lines compared with its expression in a normal liver cell line. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C was further identified as a direct target of miR-101, and the protein expression of VEGF-C was downregulated by miR-101 in HepG2 HCC cells. Furthermore, the overexpression of miR-101 and the knockdown of VEGF-C significantly inhibited HepG2 cell migration and invasion, while restoration of VEGF-C reversed the inhibitory effect of miR-101 overexpression on HepG2 cell migration and invasion. Finally, the expression of VEGF-C was notably increased in HCC tissues and cell lines. These findings suggest that miR-101 exerts a suppressive effect on HCC cell migration and invasion, at least in part through the direct inhibition of VEGF-C protein expression. Therefore, the miR-101/VEGF-C axis may serve as a potential therapeutic target for HCC metastasis.']	('Liu', 'Zhenyu')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Numerous studies have reported the aberrant expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), although very few of these studies were concerned with chemoresistance to R-CHOP in DLBCL patients. This study was designed to assess the correlation between circulating miRNA expression and chemoresistance and prognosis in DLBCL patients. At the start of the study, we demonstrated that miRNA expression levels in serum were significantly associated with those in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues, which indicated that circulating miRNAs may be powerful, non-invasive biomarkers reflecting miRNAs levels isolated from tumor tissue. Then from eight potential drug-resistant miRNAs which were deregulated in DLBCL and which had been reported to be associated with drug resistance in other carcinomas, we screened out the circulating miR-125b and miR-130a, which may related to R-CHOP resistance. Dynamic monitoring of the levels of circulating miR-125b and miR-130a further demonstrated that they were involved in recurrence, progression and chemoresistance in DLBCL patients. Finally, we demonstrated that high miR-125b indicated poor prognosis, as patients with higher miR-125b levels had a shorter overall survival. To our knowledge, this is the first study demonstrating that miR-125b and miR-130a are associated with the risk of chemoresistance in DLBCL patients, and that dynamic monitoring of the levels of circulating miR-125b and miR-130a predicts the therapeutic response and disease status of DLBCL patients.']	('Yuan', 'Wang Xin')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870226	2016	10	Sinomenine, a COX-2 inhibitor, induces cell cycle arrest and inhibits growth of human colon carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo.	['Certain non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may possess anti-tumorigenic effects in certain cancer cell types. Sinomenine (SIN) is an alkaloid from Sinomenium acutum, a Chinese medicinal plant that inhibits inflammatory reactions and that has been used in the treatment of neuralgia and rheumatic diseases. In this study, we investigated the anticancer effects of SIN against colorectal cancer in vitro and in vivo, as well as the underlying mechanisms. The effects of SIN on proliferation, cell cycle progression and cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 expression were examined in human colorectal cancer-derived SW1116 cells. The in vivo effects of SIN were examined in a model of SW1116 tumor xenograft growth in athymic nude mice. Changes in COX-2 expression induced by the biological effects of SIN were analyzed by western blot analysis. The effects of SIN treatment on G1 phase cell cycle regulators in xenografts were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Our findings demonstrate that SIN inhibits the proliferation of SW1116 cells by promoting their accumulation in the G1 phase, with concomitant suppression of COX-2 expression. Time- and dose-dependent inhibition of tumor growth and reduced toxicity were observed in nude mice administered daily intraperitoneal injections of SIN at doses of 25, 50 and 100 mg/kg. SIN-treated tumors also exhibited reduced COX-2 expression, a marked increase in Cip1/p21 protein levels and a decrease in the levels of cyclin D1 and cyclin E. SIN may be an effective chemopreventive agent against colorectal cancer. The growth inhibitory properties of SIN against colorectal cancer may be mediated via a COX-2 inhibitory effect and cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase.']	('Yang', 'Haibo')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870225	2016	10	MicroRNA-147 suppresses proliferation, invasion and migration through the AKT/mTOR signaling pathway in breast cancer.	"[""The Akt/mTOR pathway is considered to be the most frequently aberrantly activated pathway in human tumors. It is activated in a variety of types of tumor, and is therefore an attractive target for study, including it's potential regulation by microRNAs. A number of microRNAs (miRs) have been demonstrated to target the Akt/mTOR pathway. A previous study reported that miR-147 targets the EGFR-driven cell-cycle protein network in breast cancer. EGFR serves a crucial role upstream to Akt/mTOR. To define the function and mechanism of miR-147 in breast cancer, the present study assessed miR-147 expression in a normal mammary epithelial cell line and three breast cancer cell lines, and observed that miR-147 expression was markedly low in the highly invasive cell line, MDA-MB-231. Ectopic expression of miR-147 in MDA-MB-231 resulted in a reduction of the phosphorylation of crucial molecules in the Akt/mTOR pathway and the proliferation, invasion and migration of the cell line was also reduced. The effects of miR-147 expression are similar to that of shRNA which is specifically designed to silence the expression of Akt. The findings of the present study indicate that miR-147 suppressed the proliferation, invasion and migration of breast cancer cells through targeting the Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. As a new microRNA targeting Akt/mTOR pathway. Using miR-147 may therefore provide an effective therapeutic approach to suppress tumorigenicity in breast cancer.""]"	('Zhang', 'Yulong')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870224	2016	10	Immunohistochemical expression of vascular endothelial growth factor in canine oral squamous cell carcinomas.	['Angiogenesis is crucial for the growth and metastasis of malignant tumours, and various proangiogenic factors promote this process. One of these factors is vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), which appears to play a key role in tumour angiogenesis. The aim of the present study was to assess whether VEGF expression is associated with angiogenesis, disease progression and neoplastic proliferation in canine oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) tissue. VEGF immunoreactivity was quantified by immunohistochemistry in 30 specimens, including normal oral mucosa and OSCC tissues graded as well, moderately or poorly differentiated. VEGF expression was correlated with tumour cell proliferation, as assessed using the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) marker and microvessel density (data already published). The present results revealed that VEGF and PCNA expression increased significantly between normal oral tissue and neoplastic tissue, and between well and moderately/poorly differentiated tumours. In addition, VEGF expression was strongly correlated with PCNA expression and microvessel density. It was concluded that VEGF may promote angiogenesis through a paracrine pathway, stimulating endothelial cell proliferation and, similarly, may induce tumour cell proliferation through an autocrine pathway. The present results suggest that the evaluation of VEGF may be a useful additional criterion for estimating malignancy and growth potential in canine OSCCs.']	('Martano', 'Manuela')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) plays a significant role in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most prevalent form of lung cancer worldwide. Therefore, EGFR may be a useful molecular target for personalized therapy utilizing tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). Somatic activating EGFR mutations may be used to identify tumors sensitive to the effects of small-molecule EGFR-TKIs (gefitinib and erlotinib), and alternative, less frequently observed mutations, including the majority of mutations identified within exon 20, may be associated with a lack of response to TKIs.

The microarray datasets of GSE3325, including 5 clinically localized primary prostate cancers and 4 benign prostate tissues, were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) in primary prostate cancer tissues compared with benign controls were screened using the Limma package. Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed using the Database for Annotation Visualization and Integrated Discovery. Next, a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network was constructed. Additionally, microRNAs (miRNAs) associated with DEGs were predicted and miRNA-target DEG analysis was performed using a Web-based Gene Set Analysis Toolkit. Finally, the PPI network and the miRNA-target DEG network were integrated using Cytoscape. In total, 224 DEGs were screened in the prostate cancer tissues, including 113 upregulated and 111 downregulated genes. CHRM3 and epidermal growth factor (EGF) were enriched in the regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. EGF and v-myc avian myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (Myc) were enriched in the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway. EGF with the highest degree of connectivity was the hub node in the PPI network, and miR-34b could interact with Myc directly in the miRNA-target DEG network. EGF and Myc may exhibit significant roles in the progression of prostate cancer via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton and the MAPK signaling pathway. CHRM3 may activate these two pathways in prostate cancer progression. Thus, these two key factors and pathways may be crucial mechanisms during signal transduction by CHRM3 in prostate cancer.']	('Guo', 'Liqiang')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Univariate analysis showed that the age of onset, the use of radiotherapy, the endocrine treatment program, and the expression levels of progesterone receptor (PR) and CerbB2 affected the impact of endocrine treatment. The Cox regression analysis indicated that the age of onset, the use of radiotherapy, and the expression levels of PR and CerbB2 affected the disease-free survival time after endocrine therapy.

However, it remains unclear whether inducing the expression of MCPH1 may ameliorate lung cancer, and, if so, which mechanisms underlie this process. The results of the present study demonstrated that MCPH1 expression was downregulated in lung cancer tissues compared with that in normal lung tissues. Furthermore, MCPH1 overexpression in A549 non-small cell lung carcinoma cells, successfully inhibited cell proliferation via arrest of the cell cycle in the S and G2/M phases. In addition, MCPH1 overexpression promoted cell apoptosis, in association with a significant increase in the quantities of Bax and active caspase-3, as well as a decrease in the level of Bcl-2. In conclusion the present results indicated that MCPH1 is involved in the regulation of apoptosis and entry into mitosis, suggesting that MCPH1 may function as a tumor suppressor and that it may be important in the pathogenesis of lung cancer.']	('Zhou', 'Limin')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, the expression profile of CXCL12/CXCR4 was analyzed in resection specimens from the patients with GC (n=66) and in corresponding normal gastric tissues.

Likewise, in gastric carcinoma patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy, CXCR4 expression was found to be significantly upregulated (P<0.05), whereas in GC patients with lymph and vein infiltration, CXCL12 mRNA expression was significantly downregulated (P<0.05). These results demonstrate a significant inverse association between the development and progress of GC and CXCL12/CXCR4 mRNA expression.

The expression levels of miR-10a, miR-22, miR-340, miR-342-3p and miR-590-5p in 15 primary ENKTCL tissues were analyzed using quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and the protein expression levels of TIAM1 in 21 primary ENKTCL tissues were analyzed using immunohistochemistry. The expression levels of miR-10a and miR-342-3p were lower in ENKTCL tissues than in normal NK cells, but no significant differences were observed in the expression levels of miR-22, miR-340 and miR-590-5p in ENKTCL tissues, compared with normal NK cells. The low expression levels of miR-10a detected in the tissues of patients with ENKTCL were inversely correlated with the age of the patients, whereas the low expression levels of miR-342-3p measured in these samples were not correlated with any demographic or clinical features of the patients. The protein expression levels of TIAM1 were higher in ENKTCL tissues than in normal and reactive lymph node hyperplasia tissues, and positively correlated with the Ann Arbor stage and international prognostic index score of the tumors. Furthermore, the expression levels of miRNA-10a and miRNA-342-3p were inversely correlated with the protein expression levels of TIAM1 in ENKTCL tissues. These data suggest that TIAM1 may contribute to the pathogenesis of ENKTCL, and miRNA-10a and miRNA-342-3p may be involved in the development of ENKTCL via the TIAM1 pathway.']	('Huang', 'Haobo')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Furthermore, the presence of EBI3 expression was associated with a poor prognosis compared with patients without EBI3 expression. Multivariate analysis revealed that EBI3 expression was an independent predictor of overall survival (hazard ratio, 4.032; 95% confidence interval, 1.538-7.436; P=0.035). To the best of our knowledge, the present results indicate for the ?rst time that EBI3 expression is significantly associated with the progression and poor prognosis of cervical cancer. EBI3 may be a potential prognostic marker and a therapeutic target in cervical cancer.']	('Hou', 'Yan-Mei')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870211	2016	11	Molecular determinants for lymph node metastasis in clinically early-stage endometrial cancer.	"[""Patients with occult lymph node metastasis in endometrioid-type endometrial cancer (EC) are prone to the development of recurrences and have worse outcomes compared with patients without lymph node metastasis. In the current study, the aim was to identify molecular parameters associated with lymph node metastasis in EC clinically early-stage disease. A univariate analysis of differentially expressed genes, proteins and clinicopathological parameters (including myometrial invasion and tumor grade) was performed, comparing EC patients with and without lymph node metastasis (n=262 patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas). Significant parameters were introduced in a multivariate model and a gene expression pathway analysis. Lymph node metastasis was associated with expression of 268 unique genes (P<0.001), 19 unique proteins (P<0.05), tumor grade and myometrial invasion in univariate analysis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated 10 genes independently associated with lymph node metastasis and 4 independently associated proteins. Myometrial invasion was the only independent clinicopathological parameter associated with lymph node status. The enrichment pathway analysis demonstrated that expression of epidermal growth factor receptor, Bcl2 antagonist of cell death and phosphatase and tensin homolog pathways were significantly involved in lymph node metastasis (P?0.001). A gene expression signature to predict lymph node status in EC was created for future validation. Few studies have focused on the association between EC's molecular characteristics and nodal metastasis. Defining molecular risk factors for EC lymphatic nodal metastasis may help to individualize treatment and improve patient outcomes.""]"	('Bou Zgheib', 'Nadim')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870210	2016	11	18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET/CT for detection of disease in patients with prostate-specific antigen relapse following radical treatment of a local-stage prostate cancer.	['The present study aimed to retrospectively review the contribution of 18F-fluorodeoxygluose-positron emission tomography/computed tomography (18F-FDG PET/CT) in the assessment of biochemical recurrence in patients with a diagnosis of local-stage prostate cancer (PCa) who underwent radical prostatectomy (RP) or received external beam radiation therapy (EBRT). A total of 28 patients who underwent RP or received EBRT for PCa between July 2007 and April 2013, and who underwent 18F-FDG PET/CT scanning for re-staging due to biochemical recurrence were included in the present study. The mean age of the patients was 65.07 years and the standard deviation was 7.51 years (range, 51-82 years). Of the 28 patients, 23 (82.1%) underwent RP and 5 (17.9%) received definitive EBRT. Prior to scanning, all patients were required to fast for 6 h, and ~1 h after the intravenous injection of 555 MBq 18F-FDG, whole-body PET scans were performed from the skull base to the upper thighs. Whole-body CT scans were performed in the craniocaudal direction. 18F-FDG PET images were reconstructed using CT data for attenuation correction. Histopathology examination or clinical follow-up was used to confirm any suspicious recurrent or metastatic lesions. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value and accuracy of 18F-FDG PET/CT were 61.6, 75.0, 61.6, 75.0 and 71.4%, respectively. 18F-FDG PET/CT can detect local and distant metastases with a high accuracy in the assessment of biochemical recurrence, thus detecting occult metastases and allowing the re-staging of PCa in the patients receiving definitive treatment. It is considered that 18F-FDG PET/CT may be useful in re-assessing the patients with PCa receiving definitive treatment.']	('Öztürk', 'Hakan')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870207	2016	11	Analysis of ERCC1, BRCA1, RRM1 and TUBB3 as predictors of prognosis in patients with non-small cell lung cancer who received cisplatin-based adjuvant chemotherapy: A prospective study.	['Although adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy has been demonstrated to improve survival in patients with completely resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), individualized approaches to therapy are urgently required to improve the treatment efficacy and reduce unnecessary toxicity. It was hypothesized in the present study that the protein levels of excision repair cross-complementation group 1 (ERCC1), breast cancer 1 (BRCA1), ribonucleotide reductase M1 (RRM1) and class III ?-tubulin (TUBB3) may influence the therapeutic effect of adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The expression of ERCC1, BRCA1, RRM1 and TUBB3 in tissues obtained from 84 patients with NSCLC was analyzed in the present non-interventional study by immunohistochemistry prior to adjuvant chemotherapy. All patients received adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy. The primary endpoint in the present study was disease free survival (DFS). Out of the 84 tumors, the expression of ERCC1, BRCA1, RRM1 and TUBB3 was identified in 46 (55%), 11 (13%), 73 (87%) and 76 (90%) tissues, respectively. A beneficial response to adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy in DFS was associated with the absence of the expression of ERCC1 [hazard ratio (HR), 2.166; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.049-4.474; P=0.037] and BRCA1 (HR, 2.419; 95% CI, 1.127-5.193; P=0.023), but not with the expression status of RRM1 (HR, 0.568; 95% CI, 0.234-1.379; P=0.212) or TUBB3 (HR, 1.874; 95% CI, 0.448-7.842; P=0.39). In addition, patients lacking the expression of ERCC1 and BRCA1 benefited more from adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy compared with patients that expressed either ERCC1 or BRCA1 (HR, 3.102; 95% CI, 1.343-7.163; P=0.008). The expression of ERCC1 and BRCA1 was significantly associated with the DFS time in patients with NSCLC treated with adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy, respectively. The combination of the ERCC1 and BRCA1 expression levels may be a promising prognostic prediction for adjuvant cisplatin-based chemotherapy.']	('Huang', 'Zhi-Liang')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870206	2016	11	Expression of high mobility group box 1 protein predicts a poorer prognosis for patients with osteosarcoma.	['The high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) protein functions as an extracellular signaling molecule that is critical in inflammation and carcinogenesis. The HMGB1 protein is actively secreted by natural killer cells, monocytes and macrophages, and acts as an inflammatory cytokine. The present study enrolled 174 patients that underwent a tumorectomy between 2006 and 2013 in Shandong Provincial Hospital. The age of the patients ranged between 13 and 74 years, with a median age of 27 years. The tumors of the patients were staged according to the Union for International Cancer Control 2009 tumor-node-metastasis tumor staging system. Nuclear grading was based on the Fuhrman grading system. In the osteosarcoma tissue samples, HMGB1 expression was detected in 84 samples (48.3%) with a low immunoreactivity and in 90 samples (51.7%) with a high immunoreactivity. The association between clinicopathological characteristics and tumor cell HMGB1 expression (low vs. high) was summarized. The association between HMGB1 expression and tumor size, tumor stage and nuclear grade was statistically significant (P=0.034, 0.008 and 0.019, respectively). There was no significant association between HMGB1 expression and the age of the patients (P=0.335; Table I). The current study demonstrated that patients with a high HMGB1 expression (>50% cells expressing HMGB1) had poorer survival rates, and therefore a poorer prognosis, compared with patients with low HMGB1 immunostaining (10-50% cells expressing HMGB1). The results of the present study suggest that higher expression levels of HMGB1 are significantly associated with a poorer prognosis and may act as a marker for prognosis in osteosarcoma, particularly osteosarcoma recurrence. Additional studies investigating the biological features of HMGB1 may confirm the potential role of HMGB1 as a novel target for anticancer therapy in osteosarcoma.']	('He', 'Jiliang')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of a recombinant plasmid adenovirus (pAd) expressing human interferon-?1 (hIFN-?1) on the proliferation of the gastric adenocarcinoma cell line SGC-7901. For this purpose, human gastric adenocarcinoma SGC-7901 cells were infected with recombinant pAd-hIFN-?1, pAd-LacZ and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), respectively, and the subsequent effects on the proliferation of the infected cells were compared. Cell proliferation was evaluated by MTT assay, while mRNA and protein expression of hIFN-?1 were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction analysis and immunofluorescence assay, respectively. In addition, terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end labeling assay and flow cytometry were conducted to analyze the rate of cell apoptosis. The results indicated that the proliferation of gastric adenocarcinoma SGC-7901 cells was significantly inhibited by pAd-hIFN-?1. Furthermore, the apoptosis rate and the mRNA and protein expression levels of hIFN-?1 were higher in pAd-hIFN-?1-transfected cells, compared with the pAd-LacZ and PBS control groups. In conclusion, recombinant pAd-hIFN-?1 induced the expression of hIFN-?1 in gastric adenocarcinoma SGC-7901 cells, and significantly inhibited cell proliferation by promoting apoptosis in these cancer cells.']	('Bu', 'Xuefeng')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['The prognosis of patients with esophageal cancer remains poor, and the tumor-node-metastasis classification system is not sufficient for predicting patient prognoses. Therefore, the identification of novel predictive markers for esophageal cancer is required. The present study investigated the clinicopathological significance of growth arrest and DNA damage-inducible 45? (GADD45A) and p53 in resectable esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC). The study consisted of 62 patients with esophageal cancer who underwent surgery between 2001 and 2007. The expression of the GADD45A gene product (GADD45A) and the p53 protein was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The correlations among GADD45A expression, clinicopathological factors and prognosis were then analyzed in the patients with ESCC. GADD45A and p53 were expressed in 56.5% (35/62) and 48.4% (30/62) of patients, respectively. The expression of GADD45A did not show a marked correlation with that of p53. However, GADD45A expression correlated with pathological stage (stage 0-I vs. stages II-IV; P=0.014) and did not correlate with the tumor (T) or node (N) status. Furthermore, patients who were positive for GADD45A exhibited a significantly higher survival rate than those who were negative for GADD45A (log-rank test, P=0.009). Multivariate analysis indicated that T status, N status and GADD45A expression were significant variables predicting survival (hazard ratio, 2.486; 95% confidence interval, 1.168-5.290; P=0.018). Overall, GADD45A expression significantly affected the survival of patients with ESCC, and the reduced expression of GADD45A was correlated with a poor prognosis following curative surgery in these patients.']	('Ishiguro', 'Hideyuki')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

26870201	2016	11	Differential effect of psoralidin in enhancing apoptosis of colon cancer cells via nuclear factor-?B and B-cell lymphoma-2/B-cell lymphoma-2-associated X protein signaling pathways.	['Worldwide, colon cancer is the third most common cancer in terms of incidence, following lung and breast cancer. Resistance to psoralidin frequently occurs following its use as an anticancer treatment. However, the mechanisms underlying the effects of psoralidin on colon cancer, remain to be elucidated. Hence, the present study investigated the anticancer effects and potential mechanism of action of psoralidin on SW480 human colon cancer cells. In the present study, an MTT assay was performed to measure the viability of SW480 cells. Additionally, an Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate/propidium iodide apoptosis detection kit, DAPI staining assay and caspase-3 colorimetric assay kits were used to analyze the cellular apoptosis of SW480 cells. The nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) p65 activity and B-cell lymphoma-2 (Bcl-2)/Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax) protein expression of SW480 cells was detected using NF-?B colorimetric assay kits and western blot analysis, respectively. Bcl-2 inhibitor ABT-737 was added to SW480 cells and the subsequent effects and mechanism of action of psoralidin on SW480 colon cancer cells was studied. In the present study, psoralidin reduced SW480 cell viability and enhanced the cellular apoptosis of SW480 cells in a dose-dependent manner. Caspase-3 activity of SW480 cells was increased following treatment with psoralidin. Additionally, psoralidin was able to reduce the NF-?B p65 activity of SW480 cells. Furthermore, psoralidin was able to reduce Bcl-2 protein expression and increase Bax protein expression in SW480 cells. Notably, Bcl-2 inhibitor was observed to enhance the effects of psoralidin on SW480 cells. The results of the present study suggest that psoralidin may be a candidate drug for the treatment of colon cancer by inhibition of the NF-?B and Bcl-2/Bax signaling pathways.']	('Jin', 'Zhiliang')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Tumor stem cells are associated with tumor pathogenesis and development as well as invastion and metastasis. In the present study, the expression and correlation of tumor stem cell markers, octamer-binding transcription factor 4 (Oct-4) and E-cadherin (E-cad) in NSCLC and normal lung tissue were investigated. Additionally, the molecular mechanisms of invasion and metastasis of NSCLC were assessed. The expression of Oct-4 and E-cad was examined in 65 pathologically diagnosed cases of NSCLC using immunohistochemistry. The correlation between Oct-4 and E-cad, as well as the association with pathological grade and clinical staging were also analyzed. Fifteen cases of normal lung tissues served as the control. The positive expression of Oct-4 and abnormal expression of E-cad was higher in the NSCLC tissue compared to the normal lung tissue, and increased as NSCLC malignancy increased. The differences in each grade each stage were statistically significant (P<0.05). A correlation was identified between the abnormal expression of Oct-4 and E-cad (P<0.05, coefficient of contingency C=0.439). In conclusion, the expression of Oct-4 promoted the epithelial-mesenchymal transition in lung cancer.']	('Li', 'L I')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870193	2016	11	Early tumor cavitation with regorafenib in metastatic colorectal cancer: A case report.	['Tumoral cavity formation is a characteristic phenomenon reported in anti-angiogenic therapy in lung lesions. A 57-year-old male with multiple pulmonary metastases from colorectal cancer treated with an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, regorafenib, exhibited a characteristic cavity formation after the first two cycles. The decrease in the size of tumors was calculated as 38%, and there were associated decreases in the serum concentrations of the tumor markers carcinoembryonic antigen and CA19-9. After eight cycles of treatment, the cavity gradually disappeared through filling-in. This unique morphological response is not only reported in lung cancer but also in liver metastasis in colorectal cancer. However, the association between morphological changes including cavity formation and clinical benefit remains controversial. Pulmonary hemorrhage and pneumothorax are well-known consequences of cavitation, as reported with the other anti-angiogenic inhibitors. Early tumor cavitation in lung metastasis may demonstrate the predictive potential of regorafenib in colorectal cancer, although it is necessary to be mindful of toxicity.']	('Kawasaki', 'Kenta')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['Based on previous findings regarding the angiogenic activities and prognostic roles of metastasis-associated protein 1 (MTA1) in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer, the clinicopathological and prognostic significance of MTA1 protein expression, and its correlation with angiogenesis in lung invasive adenocarcinoma, were further assessed in the present study, according to the 2011 International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/American Thoracic Society/European Respiratory Society classification. High protein expression levels of MTA1 were commonly observed in patients with lung invasive adenocarcinoma, and were significantly correlated with tumor size (P=0.030), lymph node metastasis (P=0.021) and microvessel density (P=0.015). Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with high protein expression levels of MTA1 exhibited significantly shorter five-year disease-free and overall survival than those patients whose protein expression levels of MTA1 were low (24.5% vs. 48.7%, P=0.001, and 34.7% vs. 59.2%, P=0.005, respectively). In addition, Cox regression multivariate analysis demonstrated that high protein expression levels of MTA1 significantly correlated with unfavorable five-year disease-free survival (P=0.024). These findings indicate that MTA1 protein expression may possess clinical potential as an indicator of progressive phenotype. Therefore, MTA1 is a promising prognostic predictor to identify subgroups of patients with high risk of relapse, and a potentially novel therapeutic target for antiangiogenesis in patients with lung invasive adenocarcinoma.']	('Li', 'Shuhai')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['The present study aimed to investigate anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) status in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to evaluate whether abnormalities in expression were associated with patient prognosis. ALK status was investigated using immunohistochemistry (IHC), reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) assays in 342 HCC patients. In addition, rapid amplification of complementary DNA ends-coupled PCR sequencing was performed, in order to confirm the presence of ALK abnormalities in patients exhibiting ALK messenger RNA (mRNA) overexpression. The correlation between ALK expression and the clinicopathological features and prognosis of the HCC patients was statistically analyzed. The results of the present study revealed overexpression of ALK protein and mRNA; furthermore, ALK gene copy number gains were observed via IHC (44.7%; 153/342), RT-qPCR (47.4%; 162/342) and FISH (32.7%; 112/342) analyses, although ALK rearrangement or mutation was not demonstrated in the results of any of these assays. ALK protein expression levels were significantly associated with hepatitis C virus (HCV) status (P<0.001) and the presence of micrometastases (P=0.011). Within the entire patient cohort, ALK expression was associated with poor progression-free survival (PFS; P=0.041). Subsequent analysis in patient subgroups that demonstrated hepatitis B surface antigen positivity, HCV negativity, stage III-IV disease, recurrence and micrometastasis positivity revealed that overall survival (OS) and PFS were significantly reduced in those patients exhibiting ALK expression compared with those patients who were negative for ALK expression. Multivariate analysis revealed that ALK expression was an independent risk factor for OS (P=0.042) and PFS (P=0.033), particularly for patients with stage III-IV tumors. Thus, ALK may serve as a novel indicator for the metastatic behavior and prognosis of HCC.']	('Liu', 'Jianhua')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870189	2016	10	Loss of epidermal growth factor receptor expression in oral squamous cell carcinoma is associated with invasiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition.	['Inhibition of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) signaling has emerged as a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). The EGFR-directed inhibitor cetuximab is currently the only approved targeted therapy for the treatment of OSCC. EGFR status may affect the patient response to cetuximab treatment. In the present study, via analysis of the immunomarker for EGFR, it was revealed that 58.3% of the total cases investigated stained positively for EGFR expression, and furthermore, that invasiveness was inversely correlated with EGFR expression. Expression levels of EGFR were quantified, and the correlation between EGFR expression and cetuximab sensitivity was investigated using three varying grades of invasive human OSCC line. EGFR expression in high-grade invasive cells was significantly downregulated compared with that of low-grade invasive cells. There was no significant antiproliferative effect in the high-grade invasive cells treated with various concentrations of cetuximab. The EMT-associated genes, N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail, were upregulated in the high-grade invasive cells. The low-grade invasive cells exhibited characteristics of typical epithelial cells, including the expression of E-cadherin and absence of the expression of N-cadherin, vimentin and Snail. Transforming growth factor-? induced low-grade invasive cells to undergo an epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)-associated gene switch, which resulted in low levels of EGFR expression. The results of the present study suggested that loss of EGFR expression in OSCC was associated with EMT, and may have functional implications with regard to tumor invasiveness and the resistance to cetuximab treatment.']	('Kimura', 'Iyo')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870188	2016	11	Association between the rs11614913 variant of miRNA-196a-2 and the risk of epithelial ovarian cancer.	['Polymorphisms in microRNA (miR) genes and their target sites are a distinct classification of variation in the human genome, which are rapidly being identified and investigated in human cancer. A polymorphism in the miR-196a-2 locus has demonstrated significant associations with various types of cancer, including lung, breast, esophageal and gastric tumors. However, miR-196a-2 has not been fully explored in ovarian cancer, which shares similar biological characteristics with other types of cancer. Therefore, the present study aimed to elucidate the association between a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the mature sequence of miR-196a-2 (rs11614913, T/C) and the clinical features of 479 Chinese patients with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). In addition, the biological significance of this polymorphism was investigated in the OVCAR3 ovarian cancer cell line. Risk association was evaluated in 479 cases of EOC patients and 431 controls. SNPs were analyzed by using polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment length polymorphism assay. miR-196a expression was evaluated with reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The influence of miR-196a-2 rs11614913 T/C on EOC cell migration and invasion ability was further investigated in vitro. The results revealed significant differences in the homozygous CC genotype distribution in patients with EOC (n=479), compared with that of the control subjects (n=431; P=0.026). Analysis of the association between genotype and the risk of EOC revealed that individuals who carried the homozygous CC genotype were 1.34-fold more susceptible to EOC, compared with those carrying the wild-type TT and heterozygous CT genotypes [odds ratio, 1.34; 95% confidence interval, 1.04-2.17; P=0.023]. In addition, the role of this polymorphism in the production of mature miR-196a was investigated. Significantly enhanced production of mature miR-196a was revealed in the C-allelic compared with that of the T-allelic miR-196a-2 precursor (P<0.05). Further examination indicated that miR-196a significantly promoted cell migration and invasion ability in the human OVCAR3 ovarian cell line (P<0.05). In conclusion, the results indicated that the miR-196a-2 rs11614913 CC genotype may increase the risks of ovarian cancer by affecting the expression of mature miR-196a and enhancing cell migration/invasion. The current results provided evidence that the T>C polymorphism in the miR-196a-2 precursor may influence tumorigenesis and metastasis in EOC, and suggested that the functional SNP rs11614913 in the promoter region of pri-miR-196a-2 may be a potential indicator of EOC susceptibility in the population analyzed.']	('Song', 'Zhi-Shuang')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['The present study investigated the anti-tumor activity of N-(4-tertiarybutylphenyl)-4-(3-chloropyridin-2-yl)tetrahydropyrazine-1(2H)-carbox-amide (BCTC), a potent and specific inhibitor of transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily M member 8 (TRPM8) in prostate cancer (PCa) DU145 cells. TRPM8 expression in DU145 and normal prostate PNT1A cells was detected by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and western blot analysis. The effect of BCTC on DU145 cells was analyzed by flow cytometry analysis, and MTT, scratch motility and Transwell invasion assays. The molecular mechanism through which BCTC acts was investigated by western blot analysis. TRPM8 expression was increased in DU145 cells compared with PNT1A cells at the mRNA and protein levels. The present study provided evidence that inhibition of TRPM8 by BCTC reduced the viability of DU145 cells, but not PNT1A cells. In addition, BCTC inhibited cell cycle progression, migration and invasion in DU145 cells. Cell cycle-associated proteins, including phosphorylated protein kinase B, cyclin D1, cyclin dependent kinase (CDK) 2 and CDK6 were downregulated by BCTC, while phosphorylated glycogen synthase kinase 3? was upregulated. However, investigations in the present study revealed that BCTC failed to trigger apoptosis in DU145 cells. In addition, in BCTC-treated DU145 cells, phosphorylated extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 was downregulated substantially while phosphorylated p38 (p-p38) and phosphorylated c-Jun N-terminal kinases (p-JNK) were upregulated. The anti-proliferative activity of BCTC on DU145 cells was attenuated by p38 and JNK-specific inhibitors, suggesting that MAPK pathways are involved. Overall, the TRPM8 specific antagonist BCTC demonstrated excellent anti-tumor activity in PCa DU145 cells, and therefore has the potential to become a targeted therapeutic strategy against PCa.']	('Liu', 'Tao')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870184	2016	10	Knockdown of protein phosphatase 5 inhibits ovarian cancer growth in vitro.	['Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of gynecological cancer-related mortality. Serine/threonine protein phosphatase 5 (PP5, PPP5C) has been recognized to be involved in the regulation of multiple cellular signaling cascades that control diverse cellular processes, including cell growth, differentiation, proliferation, motility and apoptosis. In this study, to evaluate the functional role of PP5 in ovarian cancer cells, lentivirus-mediated RNA interference (RNAi) was applied to silence PPP5C in the human ovarian cancer cell line CAOV-3. Cell viability was measured by 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay. Cell colony forming ability was measured by colony formation. Cell cycle progression was determined by propidium iodide staining and flow cytometry. The results demonstrated that lentivirus-mediated RNAi specifically suppressed the expression of PPP5C at the mRNA and protein levels in CAOV-3 cells. Further investigations revealed that PP5 knockdown significantly inhibited the proliferation and colony formation of CAOV-3 cells. Moreover, the cell cycle of CAOV-3 cells was arrested at the G0/G1 phase following PP5 knockdown. This study highlights the crucial role of PP5 in promoting ovarian cancer cell proliferation, and provides a foundation for further study into the clinical potential of lentiviral-mediated delivery of PP5 RNAi therapy for the treatment of ovarian cancer.']	('Zheng', 'Xiaojiao')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870183	2016	11	Downregulation of survivin expression exerts antitumoral effects on mouse breast cancer cells in vitro and in vivo.	['Metastasis constantly occurs in the majority of cases of primary breast cancer at late stage or following surgical treatment. Survivin, a member of the inhibitor of apoptosis protein family, has long been recognized as a promising anticancer target, but its antitumor effects remain largely unexplored. In order to elucidate the role of survivin in breast cancer metastasis, short interfering RNA (siRNA) was used in the present study to specifically downregulate survivin expression in the murine breast cancer cell line 4T1. The results demonstrated that blocking the expression of survivin by siRNA inhibited the proliferation, migration and invasion abilities of murine breast cancer cells in vitro. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-C is a lymphatic endothelial cell-stimulating factor that may lead to the formation of lymphatic vessels in lymph nodes. In the present study, the inhibition of survivin by siRNA was able to reduce the overexpression of VEGF-C in 4T1 cells. Furthermore, intratumoral injections of the survivin-siRNA significantly inhibited the growth of orthotopically transplanted 4T1 tumors in vivo. In addition, the number of pulmonary metastases and the microlymphatic vessel density were significantly reduced in vivo, following transfection with survivin-siRNA. The results of the present study suggested that the Akt/hypoxia-inducible factor-1? signaling pathway participates in the survivin-mediated downregulation of VEGF-C expression observed in breast cancer cells treated with survivin-siRNA.

['Traditionally, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) has been considered to be a relatively homogeneous disease. However, recent data have demonstrated that human papillomavirus (HPV)-positive and HPV-negative disease are two different clinical entities associated with different outcomes. Preclinical and clinical studies have reported a divergence in treatment strategies as well as prognostic outcomes for HNSCCs that are HPV-positive versus HPV-negative. The present study describes the case of a 52-year-old man who presented with stage IVB cT2N3M0 right tonsillar HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma. Induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF), followed by chemoradiation therapy with carboplatin and 70 Gray (Gy) radiation in daily fractions was recommended. The patient completed the TPF and carboplatin treatment; however, he was unable to tolerate the radiation course, receiving a final dose of 46 Gy. A 60-day follow-up right neck salvage dissection was subsequently performed. Despite having received a partial radiation treatment of 46 Gy, the patient had no pathological evidence of disease at 60 days post radiation treatment. Repeat positron emission tomography-computed tomography at 32 months after the right neck dissection revealed no evidence of disease. The present study also discusses the current preclinical in vitro and in vivo targets for HPV-positive HNSCC and the obstacles presented in advancing clinical treatment modalities. Previous preclinical models investigating radiation sensitivity have yielded mixed results. Thus, it is important to understand and establish representative preclinical models for studying HPV and HNSCC to improve clinical research and therapeutic development. This review may guide future understanding of the role of HPV in HNSCC.']	('Wu', 'Cheng-Chia')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['The aim of the current study was to investigate the potential role of microRNA-183-5p (miR-183-5p) in the proliferation, invasion and metastasis of pancreatic cancer, and to identify promising target genes of oncogenic miR-183-5p. Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) were used to investigate whether these oncogenic microRNAs may be useful as biomarkers in pancreatic carcinoma (PaCa). Potential target genes were verified using miRDB, PicTar and TargetSCAN, and qPCR was used to detect the expression of miR-183 and suppressor of cytokine signaling 6 (SOCS-6; a potential target of miR-183) in PANC-1 PaCa cells and in the HPDE6-C7 pancreatic ductal cell line for comparison. The function of miR-183 in cell proliferation, wound healing, invasion and migration was also investigated using a miR-183 inhibitor. Western blot analysis was used to confirm SOCS-6 as a tumor suppressor and qPCR was used to detect and confirm that this potential target gene is directly regulated by miR-183. The results indicated that the expression of miR-183 in PANC-1 cells was upregulated compared with that in HPDE6-C7 cells, whilst the expression of SOCS-6 was downregulated. SOCS-6 expression was also significantly lower in PaCa tissues compared with that in matched normal pancreatic tissues from PaCa patients. Furthermore, expression of miR-183 was inversely correlated with that of SOCS-6. miR-183 knockdown decreased cell growth and motility in pancreatic cancer cells and significantly increased the expression of SOCS-6. These data suggest that oncogenic miR-183 may be useful as a pancreatic cancer biomarker. In addition, inhibition of miR-183 expression may be beneficial as PaCa treatment. SOCS-6 is a potential target gene of miR-183.']	('Miao', 'Fei')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

"[""Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a pivotal event in the progression of cancer towards metastasis. Given that pigment epithelium-derived factor (PEDF) inhibits angiogenesis, the present study analyzed whether PEDF expression is associated with EMT and prognosis in invasive ductal breast cancer (IDC). Immunohistochemical analysis was used to examine the expression levels of PEDF, E-cadherin, vimentin, Snail and nuclear factor-?B (NF-?B) in 119 cases of IDC. Correlations between PEDF expression and EMT-related genes, and clinicopathological features and clinical prognosis were analyzed. E-cadherin, vimentin, Snail and NF-?B expression was correlated with tumor size, lymph node metastasis and clinicopathological stage. PEDF expression was closely associated with tumor size. Spearman's rank correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between PEDF and E-cadherin, vimentin, Snail and NF-?B expression (P<0.05). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis demonstrated that the five-year survival rate was higher for patients with PEDF- and E-cadherin-positive tumors, but was lower for those with vimentin-, Snail- and NF-?B-positive tumors. Vimentin, E-cadherin and NF-?B levels were dependent prognostic factors of favorable outcomes in IDC, as determined by Cox multivariate analysis. PEDF expression in breast cancer was significantly associated with EMT-related genes, suggesting that it may be an EMT suppressor. However, its potential as a prognostic indicator in breast cancer warrants further investigation.""]"	('Zhou', 'Dan')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['The aim of the present study was to detect the expression levels of the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) gene in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and investigate its significance in the incidence and development of the cancer. HCC tissues and corresponding para-carcinoma liver tissues were surgically collected from 78 patients with HCC who presented to Shandong Provincial Hospital (Jinan, Shandong, China). hTERT expression at the protein and mRNA levels were detected by immunohistochemistry (streptavidin peroxidase method) and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, respectively, in the HCC tissues and corresponding para-carcinoma liver tissues of 78 HCC patients and in 12 samples of normal liver tissue. The data were analyzed using SPSS 17.0 statistical software, and employing ?2 tests and t-tests. hTERT protein was mainly expressed in the HCC cell cytoplasm, but was occasionally observed in the cell nucleus. The positive rates of hTERT protein and mRNA expression in the HCC patients were 84.62% (66/78) and 78.21% (61/78), respectively, which was significantly higher compared with the rates of 10.26% (8/78) and 8.97% (7/78) in the paired para-carcinoma liver tissues (P<0.01). hTERT protein and mRNA were not expressed in the normal liver tissues (0/12). ?2 test and t-test analysis revealed that hTERT gene expression was correlated with tumor grade, the presence/absence of a portal vein tumor thrombus, hepatitis B surface antigen positivity and a high ?-fetoprotein level (P<0.05) rather than patient age, gender or tumor size. Expression of the hTERT gene may play a pivotal role in the incidence and development of HCC. The hTERT gene potentially serves as an important molecular and biological index for diagnosing and predicating the biological behavior of HCC.']	('Zhou', 'X U')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870175	2016	11	Phosphorylation of BMK1 induces prostatic carcinoma cell proliferation by promoting entry into the S phase of the cell cycle.	['Big mitogen-activated protein kinase 1 (BMK1) is activated by mitogens and oncogenic signals, and is strongly implicated in tumorigenesis. In the present study, it was demonstrated that the activation of BMK1, but not extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)1/2, can induce proliferation in prostate cancer cells. It was found that the proliferation of epidermal growth factor (EGF)-treated cells was accelerated by 40% compared with non-treated cells using a CCK8 assay. In addition, cell cycle analysis using flow cytometry showed that the proportion of cells in the S phase increased significantly in the BMK1-activated PC-3 cells, suggesting that the activation of BMK1 promotes entry into the S phase of the cell cycle in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, western blot analysis indicated that EGF-mediated activation of BMK1, but not ERK1/2, participates in the proliferation and cell cycle regulation in prostate cancer cells. Furthermore, the effects of cell cycle regulation by the activation of BMK1 were associated with the increased expression levels of cyclin A and cyclin E, whereas the expression of cyclin B and cyclin D1 was unchanged in this process. Therefore, the present study demonstrated that the activation of BMK1 can induce proliferation by promoting entry into the S phase through the upregulation of cyclin A and cyclin E expression levels in prostate cancer cells.']	('Xiong', 'Ying')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

In the present study, the case of a patient who suffered malignant renal EAML and underwent nephrectomy is reported. The histological patterns of the tumor were composed of sheets or nests of large polygonal epithelioid cells and thick-walled blood vessels, with clear mitoses. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that the epithelioid and smooth muscle cells characteristically expressed human melanoma black-45, epithelial membrane antigen and actin. Pathological evaluation revealed malignant EAML with regional lymph node metastases. Magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray examination identified multiple liver and lung nodules at 16 months post-surgery. Since the patient did not respond to the initial treatment with doxorubicin and cisplatin, sorafenib was subsequently administered. However, the treatment was not effective, and the patient succumbed to multiple metastases six months later.']	('Guo', 'Baoyin')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['The roles of secreted frizzled-related protein-1 (SFRP1) and ?-catenin in human cancer have been widely studied, and it has recently been demonstrated that these proteins are associated with numerous human carcinomas. However, their clinical significance in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) has not been examined. The current study aimed to analyze the correlation between the expression of SFRP1 and ?-catenin, and clinicopathological characteristics in GBM patients. The expression of SFRP1 and ?-catenin was assessed by immunohistochemistry in 113 samples of GBM and 40 normal brain tissues. Compared with normal brain tissues, GBM tissues exhibited significantly lower expression of SFRP1, and higher expression of ?-catenin (both P<0.05). A Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients with positive SFRP1 expression had a significantly longer overall survival (OS) time relative to those with negative SFRP1 expression (P<0.000), and that patients with positive ?-catenin expression had a shorter OS time than those with negative ?-catenin expression (P<0.000). A multivariate Cox regression analysis indicated that adjuvant treatment, SFRP1 expression and ?-catenin expression were independent prognostic factors for OS (P<0.000, P=0.008 and P=0.001, respectively) in patients with GBM. The current data suggest that expression of SFRP1 and ?-catenin may be considered significant prognostic indicators for patients with GBM.']	('Chang', 'Liang')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

['In the present study, the presence of extracellular matrix components, including collagenous and elastic fibers, and the expression of their key regulating enzymes, were investigated in different stages of hamster tongue carcinoma development. Immunohistochemical and computer-assisted morphological analyses were performed to quantify the staining intensity and area (integral optical density) of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1 and -2, tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase (TIMP)-1 and -2, and the extent of elastic and collagenous fibers in histological sections. MMP-1, MMP-2, TIMP-1 and TIMP-2 expression levels gradually increased with tongue cancer progression, and were associated with disease pathology staging (r=0.705, 0.633, 0.759 and 0.751, respectively). By contrast, elastic fiber levels gradually decreased with cancer progression and were negatively correlated with disease staging (r=-0.881). The levels of collagenous fibers gradually increased with cancer progression and showed a positive correlation (r=0.619).

The gene expression profile, GSE53157, was downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Only 10 chips, including 3 specimens of normal thyroid tissues and 7 specimens of well-differentiated thyroid carcinomas, were analyzed in the present study. Differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) between PTC patients and normal individuals were identified. Next, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analyses of DEGs were performed. Modules in the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network were identified. Significant target genes were selected from the microRNA (miRNA) regulatory network. Furthermore, the integrated network was constructed with the miRNA regulatory and PPI network modules, and key target genes were screened. A total of 668 DEGs were identified. Modules M1, M2 and M3 were identified from the PPI network. From the modules, DEGs of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A, S100 calcium binding protein A6 (S100A6), dual specificity phosphatase 5, keratin 19, met proto-oncogene (MET) and lectin galactoside-binding soluble 3 were included in the Malacards database. In the miRNA regulatory and integrated networks, genes of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1C (CDKN1C), peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor ?, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, basic helix-loop-helix family, member e40 and reticulon 1 were the key target genes. S100A6, MET and CDKN1C may exhibit key roles in the progression and development of PTC, and may be used as specific therapeutic targets in the treatment of PTC. However, further experiments are required to confirm these results.']	('Zhao', 'Ming')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870163	2016	10	CT pelvimetry and clinicopathological parameters in evaluation of the technical difficulties in performing open rectal surgery for mid-low rectal cancer.	['The present study aimed to evaluate the predictive value of pelvic anatomical and clinicopathological parameters for use in the estimation of the likely technical difficulties that may be encountered when performing open rectal surgery for mid-low rectal cancer. Sixty consecutive patients, undergoing open rectal surgery for mid-low rectal cancer were recruited between June 2009 and April 2014. All of the surgical procedures conducted, were low anterior resection (LAR) or abdominoperineal resection (APR). The operations were performed by the same surgeon and surgical team. Pelvic dimensions and angles were measured using three-dimensional reconstruction of spiral computerized tomography (CT) images. Operative time and intraoperative blood loss were used as indicators of operative difficulty. The independent variables were pelvic anatomical and clinicopathological parameters, and the dependent variables were operative time and intraoperative blood loss. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed in order to determine the predictive significance of these variables. The pelvis width was significantly wider in females than in males (P<0.05), while the sacrococcygeal bending degree was significantly greater in males than in females (P<0.05). No significant difference were detected between the pelvis depth of females and males (P>0.05). Multivariate analyses showed that body mass index (BMI), tumor height, lymph node metastasis, anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic inlet, anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet, height of the pubic symphysis, the sacrococcygeal distance, sacrococcygeal-pubic angle and diameter of the upper pubis to the coccyx were the main factors affecting the operative time (all P<0.05), while the maximum diameter of the tumor was the primary factor affecting intraoperative blood loss (P<0.05). Between the two procedures, the clinicopathological parameters appeared to be more valuable for predicting difficulty in LAR, in which operative time was associated with tumor height and tumor staging (RC2=0.312; P<0.001). By contrast, the pelvic anatomical parameters appeared to be more valuable predictors of variation in APR, in which intraoperative blood loss was associated with the anteroposterior diameter of the mid-pelvis, the anteroposterior diameter of the pelvic outlet, the interspinous diameter, the depth of the sacral curvature and the sacropubic distance (RC2=0.608; P=0.002). BMI, tumor height and the maximum diameter of the tumor may be used to predict the operative difficulty in performing open rectal surgery for mid-low rectal cancer. In addition to the associated clinicopathological parameters, wider, shallower and less curved pelvises may make the greatest contribution to reducing operative time and intraoperative blood loss. Operative difficulty is likely to be increased in deeper and narrower pelvises, or in those with greater sacrococcygeal curvature.']	('Zhou', 'Xiao-Cong')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

"[""Endometriosis is a chronic gynecological disease with a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that affects approximately 10% of women of reproductive age. Recent reviews have demonstrated the connection between endometriosis and breast cancer, which represents the most frequently diagnosed female cancer and the most common cause of cancer-related mortality among women worldwide. The aim of this study was to conduct a survey of available published epidemiological studies indicating the association between endometriosis and breast cancer, and simultaneously to categorize the results based on the strength of the association, with the intention of the critical evaluation of the existing data. We performed a rigorous search of the PubMed/Medline database, using the key words 'endometriosis' and 'breast cancer' for all studies published in the English language until September 2015. We found 4 retrospective cohort studies, 4 case-control studies and 3 case-cohort studies that demonstrated a notable risk for developing breast cancer among women with endometriosis. By contrast, we also found 5 case-control studies, 1 prospective cohort study, 1 case-cohort study and 1 cross-sectional study that demonstrated a negative association between endometriosis and breast cancer. In conclusion, as regards the clarification of a 'robust' or 'weak' association between endometriosis and breast cancer, no definite conclusions could be drawn, due to the limited number of studies and the limitations of each of these studies. New well-designed, prospective cohort or randomized control trials with long-term follow-up are warranted in order to provide evidence-based clinical recommendations for proper counseling, screening and treatment strategies for patients with endometriosis, and hence to improve public health.""]"	('Pontikaki', 'A')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']
26870160	2016	11	Molecular-targeted therapy for elderly patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.	['Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer-related mortality in men and women. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents close to 90% of all lung cancers. When diagnosed, >50% of patients are >65 years old. Through an improved understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in lung oncogenesis, molecular-targeted approaches have become an essential element for the treatment of patients with NSCLC. As the toxicity profiles of the techniques are definitely more favorable compared with chemotherapy, they are particularly attractive for use in elderly patients, who are potentially more susceptible to the toxicity of systemic oncological therapies. However, studies on the activity of molecular-targeted agents in this aged patient setting are much more limited compared with those in their younger counterparts. In the present review, the literature on molecular-targeted therapy for elderly patients with advanced NSCLC is discussed. It is concluded that bevacizumab should be reserved only for highly select elderly patients with advanced NSCLC when the clinician deems it useful in the face of acceptable toxicities. In elderly patients with advanced epidermal growth factor receptor mutation-positive NSCLC, erlotinib and gefitinib appear to repeat the same favorable performance as that documented on a larger scale in the overall population of patients with activating mutations. A good toxicity profile is also confirmed for active molecules on different pathways, such as crizotinib.']	('Antonelli', 'Giovanna')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

Some of the evidence showed that ginsenoside Rd ameliorates ischemic stroke-induced damages through the suppression of oxidative stress and inflammation. Ginsenoside Rd can prolong neural cells' survival through the upregulation of the endogenous antioxidant system, phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT and extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase 1/2 pathways, preservation of mitochondrial membrane potential, suppression of the nuclear factor-kappa B, transient receptor potential melastatin, acid sensing ion channels 1a, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-1, protein tyrosine kinase activation, as well as reduction of cytochrome c-releasing and apoptosis-inducing factor.

['Several recent developments in linear accelerator-based radiation therapy (RT) such as fast multileaf collimators, accelerated intensity modulation paradigms like volumeric modulated arc therapy and flattening filter-free (FFF) high-dose-rate therapy have dramatically shortened the duration of treatment fractions. Deliverable photon dose distributions have approached physical complexity limits as a consequence of precise dose calculation algorithms and online 3-dimensional image guided patient positioning (image guided RT). Simultaneously, beam quality and treatment speed have continuously been improved in particle beam therapy, especially for scanned particle beams. Applying complex treatment plans with steep dose gradients requires strategies to mitigate and compensate for motion effects in general, particularly breathing motion. Intrafractional breathing-related motion results in uncertainties in dose delivery and thus in target coverage. As a consequence, generous margins have been used, which, in turn, increases exposure to organs at risk. Particle therapy, particularly with scanned beams, poses additional problems such as interplay effects and range uncertainties. Among advanced strategies to compensate breathing motion such as beam gating and tracking, deep inspiration breath hold (DIBH) gating is particularly advantageous in several respects, not only for hypofractionated, high single-dose stereotactic body RT of lung, liver, and upper abdominal lesions but also for normofractionated treatment of thoracic tumors such as lung cancer, mediastinal lymphomas, and breast cancer.

"[""Rose Bengal (RB) is an anionic water-soluble xanthene dye, which used for many years to assess eye cornea and conjunctiva damage. RB showed strong absorption maxima (?max) under visible light followed by UV-B and UV-A. RB under sunlight exposure showed a time-dependent photodegradation. Our results show that photosensitized RB generates (1)O2 via Type-II photodynamic pathway and induced DNA damage under sunlight/UV-R exposure. 2'dGuO degradation, micronuclei formation, and single- and double-strand breakage were the outcome of photogenotoxicity caused by RB. Quenching studies with NaN3 advocate the involvement of (1)O2 in RB photogenotoxicity. RB induced linoleic acid photoperoxidation, which was parallel to (1)O2-mediated DNA damage. Oxidative stress in A375 cell line (human melanoma cell line) was detected through DCF-DA assay. Photosensitized RB decreased maximum cellular viability under sunlight followed by UV-B and UV-A exposures. Apoptosis was detected as a pattern of cell death through the increased of caspase-3 activity, decreased mitochondrial membrane potential, and PS translocation through inner to outer plasma membrane. Increased cytosolic levels of Bax also advocate the apoptotic cell death. We propose a p53-mediated apoptosis via increased expression of Bax gene and protein. Thus, the exact mechanism behind RB phototoxicity was the involvement of (1)O2, which induced oxidative stress-mediated DNA and membrane damage, finally apoptotic cell death under natural sunlight exposure. The study suggests that after the use of RB, sunlight exposure may avoid to prevent from its harmful effects.""]"	('Srivastav', 'Ajeet K')	Journal of photochemistry and photobiology. B, Biology	J.

Three HPV genotypes (HPV6, 16 and 90) were detected in placental samples. Whereas, 20 different HPV genotypes were detected in vaginal sampling of the same patients, suggesting that compartment specific sub-populations of HPV may exist. The incidence of HPV16 in placental samples was almost 2-fold greater in HIV+ women compared to HIV- (p = 0.0241). HPV16 L1 expression, detected by immunochemistry, was significantly higher in HIV+ than HIV- samples (p = 0.0231). HPV16 DNA was detected in the nuclei of trophoblast cells by in situ hybridization.

Data from the National Survey of American Life, which included 3570 African American, 1438 Caribbean Black, and 891 non-Hispanic White adults were analyzed. Outcomes included at least one and multiple chronic medical conditions, from a list of 14 medical conditions (e.g., arthritis, cancer, diabetes, kidney disease, stroke, heart disease, etc.). Logistic regressions were fitted to data to determine how the association between major depressive disorder, general anxiety disorder, and one or more chronic medical conditions vary across race and ethnicity. Lifetime major depressive disorder (but not lifetime general anxiety disorder) was associated with at least one chronic medical condition among African Americans and Caribbean Blacks, but not non-Hispanic Whites. Lifetime major depressive disorder was similarly associated with multiple chronic medical conditions among African Americans, Caribbean Blacks, and non-Hispanic Whites. For Caribbean Blacks, stronger associations were found between major depressive disorder and general anxiety disorder with one or more chronic medical conditions compared to African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites. Findings suggest that race and ethnicity may shape the links between comorbid psychiatric disorders and chronic medical conditions.

We studied cancer incidence-based mortality by race and sex from 1974 to 2008 of cervix, prostate, colon and rectum, lung, leukemia, liver, pancreas, and stomach in the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. We developed a model-based mortality rate and examined rate ratio of each calendar period to the first period within each race-sex group. Cancer mortality of cervix, colon and rectum, leukemia, and stomach declined in all groups. Prostate cancer increased first in all racial groups and decreased thereafter at different pace. Lung cancer declined among males of all races but increased among females. Liver cancer increased steadily fast among white and black females, doubled in whites and black males, and climbed slowly in other races. Pancreas cancer declined among black males and females, and changed little among others. Cancer mortality trend presents heterogeneity across sites, races, and sex. Recently observed mortality decline may not reflect every cancer site or group.

26862319	2015	07	Regulatory RNAs controlling vascular (dys)function by affecting TGF-ß family signalling.	"[""Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Over the last few years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as master regulators of gene expression in cardiovascular biology and disease. miRNAs are small endogenous non-coding RNAs that usually bind to 3' untranslated region (UTR) of their target mRNAs and inhibit mRNA stability or translation of their target genes. miRNAs play a dynamic role in the pathophysiology of many CVDs through their effects on target mRNAs in vascular cells. Recently, numerous miRNAs have been implicated in the regulation of the transforming growth factor-? (TGF-?)/bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signalling pathway which plays crucial roles in diverse biological processes, and is involved in pathogenesis of many diseases including CVD. This review gives an overview of current literature on the role of miRNAs targeting TGF-?/BMP signalling in vascular cells, including endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. We also provide insight into how this miRNA-mediated regulation of TGF-?/BMP signalling might be used to harness CVD.""]"	('Kurakula', 'Kondababu')	EXCLI journal	EXCLI J	['eng']
26862314	2015	01	Immunological aspects of antitumor photodynamic therapy outcome.	['Photodynamic therapy (PDT) of cancer is an efficient and promising therapeutic modality approved for the treatment of several types of tumors and non-malignant diseases. It involves administration of a non-toxic photosensitizer followed by illumination of the tumor site with a harmless visible light. A light activated photosensitizer can transfer its energy directly to molecular oxygen, leading to production of highly toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS). Antitumor effects of PDT result from the combination of three independent mechanisms involving direct cytotoxicity to tumor cells, destruction of tumor vasculature and induction of the acute local inflammatory response. PDT-mediated inflammatory reaction is accompanied by tumor infiltration of the leukocytes, enhanced production of pro-inflammatory factors and cytokines. Photodynamic therapy is able to effectively stimulate both the innate and the adaptive arm of the immune system. In consequence, this regimen can lead to development of systemic and specific antitumor immune response. However, there are limited studies suggesting that under some specific circumstances, PDT on its own may exert some immunosuppressive effects leading to activation of immunosuppressive cells or cytokines production. In this report we briefly review all immunological aspects of PDT treatment.']	('Wachowska', 'Ma?gorzata')	Central-European journal of immunology	Cent Eur J Immunol	['eng']

['Lysosome membrane permeabilization (LMP) mediates cell death in a variety of cancer cells. However, little is known about lysosomes and LMP in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Owing to drug resistance and toxicity in CLL patients, better treatment strategies are required. Our results show that CLL cells were sensitive to the lysosomotropic agent siramesine. Furthermore, this drug was more effective in CLL cells, regardless of prognostic factors, compared with normal B cells. Siramesine caused LMP, lipid peroxidation and transcription factor EB nuclear translocation followed by mitochondrial membrane potential loss and reactive oxygen species release. Siramesine-induced cell death was blocked by lipid antioxidants, but not by soluble antioxidants or protease inhibitors. To determine whether CLL cells had altered lysosomes, we investigated sphingolipid metabolism as the lysosome is a hub for lipid metabolism. We found that CLL cells had more lysosomes, increased sphingosine-1-phosphate phosphatase 1 (SPP1) expression, and increased levels of sphingosine compared with normal B cells. Raising sphingosine levels increased LMP and cell death in CLL cells, but not in normal B cells. Together, these results show that excess sphingosine in CLL cells could contribute to their sensitivity toward LMP. Thus, targeting the lysosome could be a novel therapeutic strategy in CLL.']	('Dielschneider', 'R F')	Leukemia	Leukemia	['eng']

26858977	2016	12	Evidence for Dsg3 in regulating Src signaling by competing with it for binding to caveolin-1.	"['This data article contains extended, complementary analysis related to the research articles entitled ""Desmoglein 3, via an interaction with E-cadherin, is associated with activation of Src"" (Tsang et al., 2010) [1] and figures related to the review article entitled ""Desmoglein 3: a help or a hindrance in cancer progression?"" (Brown et al., 2014) [2]. We show here that both Src and caveolin-1 (Cav-1) associate with Dsg3 in a non-ionic detergent soluble pool and that modulation of Dsg3 levels inversely alters the expression of Src in the Cav-1 complex. Furthermore, immunofluorescence analysis revealed a reduced colocalization of Cav-1/total Src in cells with overexpression of Dsg3 compared to control cells. In support, the sequence analysis has identified a region within the carboxyl-terminus of human Dsg3 for a likelihood of binding to the scaffolding domain of Cav-1, the known Src binding site in Cav-1, and this region is highly conserved across most of 18 species as well as within desmoglein family members. Based on these findings, we propose a working model that Dsg3 activates Src through competing with its inactive form for binding to Cav-1, thus leading to release of Src followed by its auto-activation.']"	('Wan', 'Hong')	Data in brief	Data Brief	['eng']

However, its epidemiology, clinical manifestations, management, and outcome are not well understood. Methods. \u2003Cases of Candida arthritis were reviewed from 1967 through 2014. Variables included Candida spp in joint and/or adjacent bone, underlying conditions, clinical manifestations, inflammatory biomarkers, diagnostic imaging, management, and outcome. Results. \u2003Among 112 evaluable cases, 62% were males and 36% were pediatric. Median age was 40 years (range, <1-84 years). Most patients (65%) were not pharmacologically immunosuppressed. Polyarticular infection (?3 joints) occurred in 31% of cases. Clinical manifestations included pain (82%), edema (71%), limited function (39%), and erythema (22%) with knees (75%) and hips (15%) most commonly infected. Median erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 62 mm/hr (10-141) and C reactive protein 26 mg/dL (0.5-95). Synovial fluid median white blood cell count was 27 500/µL (range, 100-220 000/µL) with 90% polymorphonuclear neutrophils (range, 24-98). Adjacent osteomyelitis was present in 30% of cases. Candida albicans constituted 63%, Candida tropicalis 14%, and Candida parapsilosis 11%. Most cases (66%) arose de novo, whereas 34% emerged during antifungal therapy. Osteolysis occurred in 42%, joint-effusion in 31%, and soft tissue extension in 21%. Amphotericin and fluconazole were the most commonly used agents. Surgical interventions included debridement in 25%, irrigation 10%, and drainage 12%. Complete or partial response was achieved in 96% and relapse in 16%. Conclusion. \u2003Candida arthritis mainly emerges as a de novo infection in usually non-immunosuppressed patients with hips and knees being most commonly infected. Localizing symptoms are frequent, and the most common etiologic agents are C albicans, C tropicalis, and C parapsilosis.

After unilateral recurrent laryngeal nerve section in New Zealand White rabbits, irradiated and nonirradiated ?-glucan were injected into paralyzed vocal folds. Irradiated ?-glucan remained at the paralyzed vocal fold without definite inflammatory signs on endoscopy. High-speed recordings of vocal fold vibration showed decreased vocal gap in irradiated group compared to nonirradiated group. Histologically, the laryngeal epithelium and lamina propria remained intact, without inflammatory cell infiltration. Our newly developed injection material, irradiated ?-glucan, showed excellent biocompatibility and remained longer than nonirradiated ?-glucan in vivo, suggesting irradiated hydrogels as a new therapeutic approach that may be useful for the long-term treatment of vocal fold palsy.']	('Lim', 'Youn-Mook')	BioMed research international	Biomed Res Int	['eng']

['Quantum dots (QDs) have recently been investigated as fluorescent probes for detecting a very small number of biomolecules and live cells; however, the establishment of molecular imaging technology with on-off control of QD fluorescence remains to be established. Here we have achieved the fluorescence off state of QDs with the conjugation of black hole quencher (BHQ) molecules intermediated with peptide by using streptavidin-QDs585 and biotin-pep-BHQ-1. The fluorescence of streptavidin-QDs585 was decreased by the addition of biotin-pep-BHQ-1 in a dose-dependent manner. It has been suggested that the decrease in QDs585 fluorescence occurred through a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) mechanism from the analysis of fluorescence intensity and lifetime of streptavidin-QDs585 and QDs585-pep-BHQ-1. QDs585 fluorescence could be quenched by more than 60% efficiency in this system. The sequence of intermediate peptide (pep) was GPLGVRGK, which can be cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) produced by cancer cells. QDs585-pep-BHQ-1 is thus expected to detect the MMP production by the recovery of QDs585 fluorescence as a new bioanalytical agent for molecular imaging.']	('Pillai', 'Sreenadh Sasidharan')	Cell medicine	Cell Med	['eng']

We also compared age and body mass index to other variables. The mean myocardial FDG uptake showed no significant difference between summer and winter months. Average outdoor temperature did not correlate significantly with myocardial SUVmax in either summer or winter. The heterogeneity of myocardial FDG uptake did not differ significantly between seasons.

['It is increasingly argued that cancer stem cells are not a cellular phenotype but rather a transient state that cells can acquire, either through intrinsic signaling cascades or in response to environmental cues. While cancer stem cell plasticity is generally associated with increased aggressiveness and treatment resistance, we set out to thoroughly investigate the impact of different rates of plasticity on early and late tumor growth dynamics and the response to therapy. We develop an agent-based model of cancer stem cell driven tumor growth, in which plasticity is defined as a spontaneous transition between stem and nonstem cancer cell states. Simulations of the model show that plasticity can substantially increase tumor growth rate and invasion. At high rates of plasticity, however, the cells get exhausted and the tumor will undergo spontaneous remission in the long term. In a series of in silico trials, we show that such remission can be facilitated through radiotherapy. The presented study suggests that stem cell plasticity has rather complex, nonintuitive implications on tumor growth and treatment response. Further theoretical, experimental, and integrated studies are needed to fully decipher cancer stem cell plasticity and how it can be harnessed for novel therapeutic approaches.']	('Poleszczuk', 'Jan')	Stem cells international	Stem Cells Int	['eng']

Results. The mean IL-6 level was 6.6\u2009pg/mL in CRC patients and 2.6\u2009pg/mL in healthy controls. Using a cutoff of 6.3\u2009pg/mL, obtained using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, 57 patients had a high IL-6 level. The mean value was higher for stage II disease than for stage III disease. IL-6 status correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP) and carcinoembryonic antigen levels, obstruction, and pT4 disease. The OS differed according to the IL-6 status for all patients, whereas the DFS differed for all patients and for those with stage II disease. The Cox proportional hazards model showed that pT4 disease was an independent risk factor for recurrence in all CRC patients; IL-6, CRP, and pT4 were significant risk factors in stage II patients. Conclusions. The preoperative IL-6 level influences the risk of CRC recurrence.']	('Shiga', 'Kazuyoshi')	Gastroenterology research and practice	Gastroenterol Res Pract	['eng']
26858751	2016	12	Surrounding Gastric Mucosa Findings Facilitate Diagnosis of Gastric Neoplasm as Gastric Adenoma or Early Gastric Cancer.	['Background and Aim. It is difficult to master the skill of discriminating gastric adenoma from early gastric cancer by conventional endoscopy or magnifying endoscopy combined with narrow-band imaging, because the colors and morphologies of these neoplasms are occasionally similar. We focused on the surrounding gastric mucosa findings in order to determine how to discriminate between early gastric cancer and gastric adenoma by analyzing the characteristics of the gastric background mucosa. Methods. We retrospectively examined 146 patients who underwent endoscopic submucosal dissection for gastric neoplasm between October 2009 and January 2015. The boundary of atrophic gastritis was classified endoscopically according to the Kimura-Takemoto classification system. Of 146 lesions, 63 early gastric cancers and 21 gastric adenomas were ultimately evaluated and assessed. Results. Almost all gastric adenomas were accompanied by open-type gastritis, whereas 47 and 16 early gastric cancers were accompanied by open-type and closed-type gastritis, respectively (p = 0.037). Conclusions. The evaluation of the boundary of atrophic gastritis associated with gastric neoplasms appears to be useful for discrimination between early gastric cancer and gastric adenoma. When gastric neoplasm is present in the context of surrounding localized gastric atrophy, gastric cancer is probable but not certain.']	('Miike', 'Tadashi')	Gastroenterology research and practice	Gastroenterol Res Pract	['eng']
26858748	2016	12	Usefulness of Acoustic Monitoring of Respiratory Rate in Patients Undergoing Endoscopic Submucosal Dissection.	"[""Aim. The study assessed the usefulness of a recently developed method for respiratory rate (RR) monitoring in patients undergoing endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) under deep sedation. Methods. Study subjects comprised 182 consecutive patients with esophageal cancer or gastric cancer undergoing ESD. The usefulness of acoustic RR monitoring was assessed by retrospectively reviewing the patients' records for age, gender, height, weight, past history, serum creatinine, RR before ESD, and total dose of sedative. Results. Respiratory suppression was present in 37.9% of (69/182) patients. Continuous monitoring of RR led to detection of respiratory suppression in all these patients. RR alone was decreased in 24 patients, whereas both RR and blood oxygen saturation were decreased in 45 patients. Univariate analysis showed female gender, height, weight, and RR before treatment to be significantly associated with respiratory suppression. Multivariate analysis showed RR before treatment to be the only significant independent predictor [odds ratio (OR) 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.73-0.95, and P = 0.006] of respiratory suppression. Conclusion. In this study, the difference in RR before treatment between patients with and without respiratory suppression was subtle. Therefore, we suggest that acoustic RR monitoring should be considered in patients undergoing ESD under sedation to prevent serious respiratory complications.""]"	('Suzuki', 'Takayoshi')	Gastroenterology research and practice	Gastroenterol Res Pract	['eng']

['Cytarabine is the primary chemotherapeutic agent used for treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Disease relapse after initial remission remains one of the most pressing therapeutic challenges in the treatment of AML. Relapsed disease is often resistant to cytarabine and subsequent salvage therapy is ineffective. Recent studies have shown that some microRNAs (miRNAs) are associated with prognosis, but have not yet explored the role of miRNAs in cellular response to cytarabine. We identified 20 miRNAs that associate with the in vitro cytarabine chemo-sensitivity or apoptotic response of eight AML cell lines. Out of the 20 miRNAs, data on 18 miRNAs was available in AML patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Our stepwise-integrated analyses (step 1 - miRNA-target mRNA that were significantly correlated in AML patients; step 2 - mRNAs from step 1 with significant association with overall survival (OS)) identified 23 unique miRNA-mRNA pairs predictive of OS in AML patients. As expected HOX genes (HOXA9, HOXB7, and HOXA10) were identified to be regulated by miRs as well as predictive of worse OS. Additionally, miR107-Myb, miR-378-granzyme B involved in granzyme signaling and miR10a-MAP4K4 were identified to be predictive of outcome through integrated analysis. Although additional functional validations to establish clinical/pharmacologic importance of miRNA-mRNA pairs are needed, our results from RNA electrophoretic mobility shift assay confirmed binding of miR-10a, miR-378, and miR-107 with their target genes GALNT1, GZMB, and MYB, respectively. Integration of pathogenic and pharmacologically significant miRNAs and miRNA-mRNA relationships identified in our study opens up opportunities for development of targeted/miRNA-directed therapies.']	('Bhise', 'Neha S')	Frontiers in pharmacology	Front Pharmacol	['eng']

['The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxic potential of a novel nickel(II) complex (NTC) against WiDr and HT-29 human colon cancer cells by determining the IC50 using the standard MTT assay. The NTC displayed a strong suppressive effect on colon cancer cells with an IC50 value of 6.07 ± 0.22 ?M and 6.26 ± 0.13 ?M against WiDr and HT-29 respectively, after 24 h of treatment. Substantial reduction in the mitochondrial membrane potential and increase in the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria directed the induction of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway by the NTC. Activation of this pathway was further evidenced by significant activation of caspase 3/7 and 9. The NTC was also shown to activate the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis via activation of caspase-8 which is linked to the suppression of NF-?B translocation to the nucleus. Cell cycle arrest in the G1 phase was confirmed by flow cytometry and up-regulation of glutathione reductase expression was quantified by qPCR. Results of the current work indicates that NTC possess a potent cancer cell abolishing activity by simultaneous induction of intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis in colon cancer cell lines.']	('Samie', 'Nima')	Frontiers in pharmacology	Front Pharmacol	['eng']
26857888	2016	12	Effects of physical exercise during adjuvant breast cancer treatment on physical and psychosocial dimensions of cancer-related fatigue: A meta-analysis.	"[""Cancer-related fatigue has a multidimensional nature and complaints typically increase during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. Physical exercise might prevent or reduce cancer-related fatigue. So far, no meta-analysis has investigated the effects of physical exercise on different dimensions of fatigue. The aim of the present meta-analysis was to investigate the effects of physical exercise during adjuvant breast cancer treatment on physical and psychosocial dimensions of fatigue. We performed a systematic literature search in PubMed, Embase and the Cochrane Library in June 2015. Randomised controlled trials reporting the effects of physical exercise during adjuvant breast cancer treatment on different dimensions of fatigue were included. Pooled effects of 6 exercise programmes (including 784 patients) showed significant beneficial exercise effects on general fatigue (ES: -0.22, 95% CI -0.38; -0.05) and physical fatigue (ES: -0.35, 95% CI -0.49; -0.21). Effects on fatigue subscales 'reduced activity' (ES: -0.22, 95% CI -0.38; -0.05) and 'reduced motivation' (ES: -0.18, 95% CI -0.35; -0.01) were also in favour of physical exercise. No effects were found on cognitive and affective fatigue. Including only the supervised exercise programmes (n=4 studies), slightly larger pooled effect estimates were found on general fatigue (ES: -0.25, 95% CI -0.47; -0.04) and physical fatigue (-0.39, 95% CI -0.56; -0.23). In conclusion, physical exercise during adjuvant breast cancer treatment has beneficial effects on general fatigue, physical fatigue, 'reduced activity' and 'reduced motivation', but did not show effects on cognitive and affective fatigue. Largest effect sizes are found for physical fatigue, suggesting that this is the fatigue dimension most sensitive to physical exercise.""]"	('van Vulpen', 'Jonna K')	Maturitas	Maturitas	['eng']

26856931	2016	12	Infertility and uterine fibroids.	"[""Uterine fibroids are the most common tumors in women and their prevalence is higher in patients with infertility. At present, they are classified according to their anatomical location, as no classification system includes additional parameters such as their size or number. There is a general agreement that submucosal fibroids negatively affect fertility, when compared to women without fibroids. Intramural fibroids above a certain size (>4\xa0cm), even without cavity distortion, may also negatively influence fertility. However, the presence of subserosal myomas has little or no effect on fertility. Many possible theories have been proposed to explain how fibroids impair fertility: mechanisms involving alteration of local anatomical location, others involving functional changes of the myometrium and endometrium, and finally endocrine and paracrine molecular mechanisms. Nevertheless, any of the above mentioned mechanisms can cause reduced reproductive potential, thereby leading to impaired gamete transport, reduced ability for embryo implantation, and creation of a hostile environment. The published experience defines the best practice strategy, as not many large, well-designed, and properly powered studies are available. Myomectomy appears to have an effect in fertility improvement in certain cases. Excision of submucosal myomas seems to restore fertility with pregnancy rates after surgery similar to normal controls. Removal of intramural myomas affecting pregnancy outcome seems to be associated with higher pregnancy rates when compared to non-operated controls, although evidence is still n?t sufficient. Treatment of subserosal myomas of reasonable size is not necessary for fertility reasons. The results of endoscopic and open myomectomy are similar; thus, endoscopic treatment is the recommended approach due to its advantages in patient's postoperative course.""]"	('Zepiridis', 'Leonidas I')	Best practice & research.

['NK cell cytotoxicity against residual leukemic cells is crucial for immune system reconstitution after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). Since immune recovery after transplant still remains a major concern, we studied the counterbalance of NK cell receptors after HSCT and its importance in NK cell functional recovery. We investigated NK cell reconstitution in 27 acute leukemia patients at different time points following HLA-matched allogeneic HSCT compared to those of donors. NK cells were evaluated for their cytotoxicity in a standard (51)Cr-release assay against target cells and also analyzed for their receptors expression using flow cytometry. Early after transplant, we found higher percentage of CD56(bright) NK cells, increased levels of NKG2A and NCRs as well as decreased levels of KIRs expression on NK cells associated with an impaired cytotoxicity of these cells. All the abnormalities were normalized by one year after HSCT when CD56(bright) NK cells gradually differentiated into CD56(dim) subset. Collectively, we confirmed a gradual increase of CD56(dim) NK cells expressing NCRs with the significant decrease in NKG2A expression on NK cells. This finding was also associated with the recovery of NK cell cytotoxicity that suggests an important role for the kinetics of NK cell receptors during cell maturation in HSCT outcome.']	('Ghasemzadeh', 'Mehran')	Leukemia research	Leuk.

['This work focuses on improving the efficacy of photoactivatable Ru complexes for photodynamic therapy by employing cross-linked nanoassemblies (CNAs) as a delivery approach. The effects of complex photoactivation, hydrophobicity, and solution ionic strength and pH on complex loading and release from CNAs were analyzed. The cell cytotoxicity of CNA formulations was similar to free Ru complexes despite reduced or eliminated DNA interactions. The release rate and the amount of each Ru complex released (%) varied inversely with complex hydrophobicity, while the effect of solution ionic strength was dependent on complex hydrophobicity. Premature release of two photoactivatable prodrugs prior to irradiation was believed to account for higher activity in cells studies compared to DNA interaction studies; however, for photostable 1O2 generator-loaded CNAs this cannot explain the high cytotoxicity and lack of DNA interactions because release was incomplete after 48 hrs. The cause remains unclear, but among other possibilities, accelerated release in a cell culture environment may be responsible.']	('Dickerson', 'M')	Journal of materials chemistry.

['Elevated expression of NF-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2), a nuclear transcription factor, is a frequent genetic abnormality seen in this malignancy and is an important contributor to chemoresistance in cancer therapy. In the present study, we investigated if Nrf2 was associated with drug resistance in tamoxifen-resistant MCF-7 (MCF-7/TAM) cells, and whether EGCG, major flavonoid isolated from green tea, could reverse drug resistance in MCF-7/TAM cells. Our results showed that the endogenous expression of Nrf2 as well as its target proteins heme oxygenase-1, NADP (H):quinone oxidoreductase in MCF-7/TAM cells was higher than that in MCF-7 cells. Epicatechin gallate (EGCG) significantly sensitizes MCF-7/TAM cells to tamoxifen and dramatically reduced Nrf2 expression at both the messenger RNA and protein, leading to a reduction of Nrf2-downstream genes. In addition, using siRNA technique, we found that the intracellular Nrf2 protein level was significantly decreased in MCF-7/TAM cells and tamoxifen resistance was partially reversed by Nrf2 siRNA. Combination of siRNA-directed gene silencing with EGCG downregulated the Nrf2-dependent response and partly reversed tamoxifen resistance in MCF-7/TAM cells in a synergic manner. These results suggested that combining the chemotherapeutic effect of EGCG with siRNA-mediated Nrf2 knock-down results in the feasibility of using Nrf2 inhibitors to increase efficacy of chemotherapeutic drugs.']	('Esmaeili', 'Mohammad Ali')	Journal of chemical biology	J Chem Biol	['eng']

['Oesophagogastric anastomosis after oesophagus resection is commonly performed on the neck. Even though a few different techniques of oesophagogastric anastomosis have been previously detailed, both manual and mechanical procedures have been burdened with leakages and strictures. Our simple technique of oesophagogastric anastomosis is a modification of mechanical anastomosis with the use of a circular stapler in order to prevent postoperative leak and concomitant mediastinal complications. Since 2008, we have performed nine oesophagogastric anastomoses following oesophagus resection. The mean age of the operated patients was 54 years. There was no mortality among the operated patients in the early post-operative period. The mean follow-up period for the patients operated on in our department was 17 months until the time of the analysis. None of the patients showed any leakage or stricture, and no mediastinal complications were reported in the group. Following our own experience, mechanical anastomosis with the use of a circular stapler seems to decrease the time of the operation as well as significantly reducing the incidence of leakages from the anastomosis. This type of anastomosis may decrease the number of postoperative strictures and the most dangerous mediastinal infections.']	('Zieli?ski', 'Jacek')	Kardiochirurgia i torakochirurgia polska = Polish journal of cardio-thoracic surgery	Kardiochir Torakochirurgia Pol	['eng']

Forty (52\xa0%) patients developed cGVHD; 24 (60\xa0%) extensive stage while 16 (40\xa0%) limited stage. Oral cavity was the commonest site of involvement (25 patients) followed by liver, skin and lung. We found that female donor to male recipient transplant and diagnosis of acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) were the only factors associated with increased risk of cGVHD. The incidence of leukemia relapse was 18\xa0% in patients who developed cGVHD compared to 51\xa0% in those who did not (P\xa0=\xa00.002). Four year overall survival and relapse free survival (RFS) were 62 and 46\xa0% in patients who developed cGVHD compared to 29\xa0% (P\xa0<\xa00.001) and 29\xa0% (P\xa0<\xa00.001) in patients who did not develop cGVHD, respectively.

26855164	2016	12	Electrochemical determination of microRNAs based on isothermal strand-displacement polymerase reaction coupled with multienzyme functionalized magnetic micro-carriers.	['MicroRNAs (miRNAs) show great potential for disease diagnostics due to their specific molecular profiles. Detection of miRNAs remains challenging and often requires sophisticated platforms. Here we report a multienzyme-functionalized magnetic microcarriers-assisted isothermal strand-displacement polymerase reaction (ISDPR) for quantitative detection of miRNAs. Magnetic micro-carriers (MMCs) were functionalized with molecular beacons to enable miRNAs recognition and magnetic separation. The target miRNAs triggered a phi29-mediated ISDPR, which can produce biotin-modified sequences on the MMCs. Streptavidin-alkaline phosphatase was then conjugated to the MMC surface through biotin-streptavidin interactions. In the presence of 2-phospho-L-ascorbic acid, miRNAs were quantitatively determined on a screen-printed carbon electrode from the anodic current of the enzymatic product. We show that this method enables detection of miRNAs as low as 9 fM and allows the discrimination of one base mismatched sequence. The proposed method was also successfully applied to analyze miRNAs in clinical tumor samples. This paper reports a new strategy for miRNAs analysis with high sensitivity, simplicity, and low cost. It would be particularly useful for rapid point-of-care testing of miRNAs in clinical laboratory.']	('Ma', 'Wen')	Biosensors & bioelectronics	Biosens Bioelectron	['eng']
26854941	2016	12	Automated classification of brain tumor type in whole-slide digital pathology images using local representative tiles.	['Computerized analysis of digital pathology images offers the potential of improving clinical care (e.g. automated diagnosis) and catalyzing research (e.g. discovering disease subtypes). There are two key challenges thwarting computerized analysis of digital pathology images: first, whole slide pathology images are massive, making computerized analysis inefficient, and second, diverse tissue regions in whole slide images that are not directly relevant to the disease may mislead computerized diagnosis algorithms. We propose a method to overcome both of these challenges that utilizes a coarse-to-fine analysis of the localized characteristics in pathology images. An initial surveying stage analyzes the diversity of coarse regions in the whole slide image. This includes extraction of spatially localized features of shape, color and texture from tiled regions covering the slide. Dimensionality reduction of the features assesses the image diversity in the tiled regions and clustering creates representative groups. A second stage provides a detailed analysis of a single representative tile from each group. An Elastic Net classifier produces a diagnostic decision value for each representative tile. A weighted voting scheme aggregates the decision values from these tiles to obtain a diagnosis at the whole slide level. We evaluated our method by automatically classifying 302 brain cancer cases into two possible diagnoses (glioblastoma multiforme (N = 182) versus lower grade glioma (N = 120)) with an accuracy of 93.1% (p < 0.001). We also evaluated our method in the dataset provided for the 2014 MICCAI Pathology Classification Challenge, in which our method, trained and tested using 5-fold cross validation, produced a classification accuracy of 100% (p < 0.001). Our method showed high stability and robustness to parameter variation, with accuracy varying between 95.5% and 100% when evaluated for a wide range of parameters. Our approach may be useful to automatically differentiate between the two cancer subtypes.']	('Barker', 'Jocelyn')	Medical image analysis	Med Image Anal	['eng']
26854430	2016	12	Novel cis-selective and non-epimerisable C3 hydroxy azapodophyllotoxins targeting microtubules in cancer cells.	['Podophyllotoxin (PT) and its clinically used analogues are known to be powerful antitumour agents. These compounds contain a trans fused strained ?-lactone system, a feature that correlates to the process of epimerisation, whereby the trans ?-lactone system of ring D opens and converts to the more thermodynamically stable cis epimer. Since these cis epimers are known to be either less active or lacking antitumour activity, epimerisation is an undesirable feature from a chemotherapeutic point of view. To circumvent this problem, considerable efforts have been reported, amongst which is the synthesis of azapodophyllotoxins where the stereocentres at C2 and C3 are removed in order to preclude epimerisation. Herein we report the identification of a novel C3 hydroxy, cis-selective ?-lactone configuration of ring C in the azapodophyllotoxin scaffold, through an efficient stereoselective multicomponent reaction (MCR) involving fluorinated and non-fluorinated aldehydes. This configuration releases the highly strained trans ?-lactone system in podophyllotoxin analogues into the more thermodynamically stable cis ?-lactone motif and yet retains significantly potent activity. These compounds were evaluated against the human cancer lines MCF-7 and 22Rv1 in\xa0vitro. Fourteen out of the seventeen tested compounds exhibited sub-micromolar activity with IC50 values in the range of 0.11-0.91\xa0?M, which is comparable and in some cases better than the activity profile of etoposide in this assay. Interestingly, we obtained strong evidence from spectroscopic and X-ray data analyses that the previously reported structure of similar analogues is not accurate. Molecular modelling performed using the podophyllotoxin binding site on ? tubulin revealed a novel binding mode of these analogues. Furthermore, sub-cellular study of our compounds using immunolabelling and confocal microscopy analyses showed strong microtubule disruptive activity, particularly in dividing cells.']	('Kandil', 'Sahar')	European journal of medicinal chemistry	Eur J Med Chem	['eng']
26854170	2015	11	The Role of Diffusion-Weighted Imaging (DWI) in Locoregional Therapy Outcome Prediction and Response Assessment for Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC): The New Era of Functional Imaging Biomarkers.	['Reliable response criteria are critical for the evaluation of therapeutic response in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Current response assessment is mainly based on: (1) changes in size, which is at times unreliable and lag behind the result of therapy; and (2) contrast enhancement, which can be difficult to quantify in the presence of benign post-procedural changes and in tumors presenting with a heterogeneous pattern of enhancement. Given these challenges, functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) techniques, such as diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) have been recently investigated, aiding specificity to locoregional therapy response assessment and outcome prediction. Briefly, DWI quantifies diffusion of water occurring naturally at a cellular level (Brownian movement), which is restricted in multiple neoplasms because of high cellularity. Disruption of cellular integrity secondary to therapy results in increased water diffusion across the injured membranes. This review will provide an overview of the current literature on DWI therapy response assessment and outcome prediction in HCC following treatment with locoregional therapies.']	('Ludwig', 'Johannes M')	Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)	Diagnostics (Basel)	['eng']

['Management of patients with prostate cancer is currently based on imperfect clinical, biological, radiological and pathological evaluation. Prostate cancer aggressiveness, including metastatic potential, remains difficult to accurately estimate. In an attempt to better adapt therapeutics to an individual (personalized medicine), reliable evaluation of the intrinsic molecular biology of the tumor is warranted, and particularly for all tumor sites (primary tumors and secondary sites) at any time of the disease progression. As a consequence of their natural tendency to grow (passive invasion) or as a consequence of an active blood vessel invasion by metastase-initiating cells, tumors shed various materials into the bloodstream. Major efforts have been recently made to develop powerful and accurate methods able to detect, quantify and/or analyze all these circulating tumor materials: circulating tumors cells, disseminating tumor cells, extracellular vesicles (including exosomes), nucleic acids, etc. The aim of this review is to summarize current knowledge about these circulating tumor materials and their applications in translational research.']	('Vlaeminck-Guillem', 'Virginie')	Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)	Diagnostics (Basel)	['eng']

Initial screening of patients at risk for HCC is performed with ultrasound. Confirmation of HCC can then be obtained by Computed Tomography (CT) or Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), due to the relatively high specificity of both techniques. This article will focus on reviewing MRI techniques for imaging HCC, felt by many to be the exam of choice for HCC diagnosis. MRI relies heavily upon the use of gadolinium-based contrast agents and while primarily extracellular gadolinium-based contrast agents are used, there is an emerging role of hepatobiliary contrast agents in HCC imaging. The use of other non-contrast enhanced MRI techniques for assessing HCC will also be discussed and these MRI strategies will be reviewed in the context of the pathophysiology of HCC to help understand the MR imaging appearance of HCC.']	('Niendorf', 'Eric')	Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)	Diagnostics (Basel)	['eng']

The current treatment regimen is based on six consecutive doses of (223)RaCl? at 4 week intervals and the administered activity dose, 50 kBq/kg per cycle is based on patient weight. We analyzed two patients using quantitative serial gamma imaging to estimate dosimetry in tumors and see possible pharmacokinetic differences in the treatment cycles. The lesions were rather well visualized in gamma scintigraphy in spite of low gamma activity (<1.1% gamma radiation) at 0, 7 and 28 days using 30-60 min acquisition times. Both our patients analyzed in serial gamma imagings, had two lesions in the gamma imaging field, the mean counts of the relative intensity varied from 27.8 to 36.5 (patient 1), and from 37.4 to 82.2 (patient 2). The half-lives varied from 1.8 days to 4.5 days during the six cycles (patient 1), and from 1.5 days to 3.6 days (patient 2), respectively. In the lesion half-lives calculated from the imaging the maximum difference between the treatment cycles in the same lesion was 2.0-fold (1.8 vs. 3.6). Of these patients, patient 1 demonstrated a serum PSA response, whereas there was no PSA response in patient 2. From our data, there were maximally up to 4.0-fold differences (62.1 vs. 246.6 ) between the relative absorbed radiation doses between patients as calculated from the quantitative standardized imaging to be delivered in only two lesions, and in the same lesion the maximum difference in the cycles was up to 2.3-fold (107.4 vs. 246.6). Our recommendation based on statistical simulation analysis, is serial measurement at days 0-8 at least 3 times, this improve the accuracy significantly to study the lesion activities, half-lives or calculated relative absorbed radiation doses as calculated from the imaging. Both our patients had originally two metastatic sites in the imaging field; the former patient demonstrated a serum PSA response and the latter demonstrated no PSA response. In these two patients there was no significant difference in the lesion activities, half-lives or calculated relative absorbed radiation doses as calculated from the quantitative imaging. Our results, although preliminary, suggest that dose monitoring can be included as a part of this treatment modality. On the other hand, from the absorbed radiation doses, the response cannot be predicted because with very similar doses, only the former patient responded.']	('Kairemo', 'Kalevi')	Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)	Diagnostics (Basel)	['eng']

['To date, empirical literature has generally been considered lacking in relation to neuroendocrine carcinomas (NECs), the highly malignant subgroup of neuroendocrine neoplasms. NECs are often found in the lungs or the gastroenteropancreatic (GEP) system and can be of small or large cell type. Concentrating on GEP-NECs, we can conclude that survival times are poor, with a median of only 4-16 months depending on disease stage and primary site. Further, this aggressive disease appears to be on the rise, with incidence numbers increasing while survival times are stagnant. Treatment strategies concerning surgery are often undecided and second-line chemotherapy is not yet established. After an analysis of over 2600 articles, we can conclude that there is indeed more empirical literature concerning GEP-NECs available than previously assumed. This unique review is based on 333 selected articles and contains detailed information concerning all aspects of GEP-NECs. Namely, the classification, histology, genetic abnormalities, epidemiology, origin, biochemistry, imaging, treatment and survival of GEP-NECs are described.

In many of these, PET/CT has shown to be useful at different stages of the disease: diagnosis, staging or re-staging, treatment response assessment, and recurrence. Some of the advantages of this imaging modality versus CT, MRI, bone scan, mammography, or ultrasound, are based on its great diagnostic capacity since, according to the radiopharmaceutical used, it reflects metabolic changes that often occur before morphological changes and therefore allows us to stage at diagnosis. Moreover, another advantage of this technique is that it allows us to evaluate the whole body so it can be very useful for the detection of distant disease. With regard to breast cancer, FDG-PET/CT has proven to be important when recurrence is suspected or in the evaluation of treatment response. The technological advancement of PET equipment through the development of new detectors and equipment designed specifically for breast imaging, and the development of more specific radiopharmaceuticals for the study of the different biological processes of breast cancer, will allow progress not only in making the diagnosis of the disease at an early stage but also in enabling personalized therapy for patients with breast cancer.']	('Vercher-Conejero', 'Jose Luis')	Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)	Diagnostics (Basel)	['eng']

As molecular chaperones, HSPs play crucial roles in protein homeostasis, apoptosis, invasion and cellular signaling transduction. The induction of HSPs is an important part of heat shock response, which could help cancer cells to adapt to stress conditions. Because of the constant stress condition in tumor microenvironment, HSPs overexpression is widely reported in many human cancers. In light of the significance of HSPs for cancer cells to survive and obtain invasive phenotype under stress condition, HSPs are often associated with poor prognosis and treatment resistance in many types of human cancers. It has been described that upregulation of HSPs may serve as diagnostic and prognostic markers in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Targeting HSPs with specific inhibitor alone or in combination with chemotherapy regimens holds promise for the improvement of outcomes for HCC patients.

At two centers, 42 patients underwent RAPN. Radius, Exo/Endophytic, Nearness, Anterior/Posterior, Location (R.E.N.A.L.) nephrometry and PADUA scores of patients were calculated by computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Intra- and perioperative (0-30 days) complications were evaluated using modified Clavien classification. A four-arm da Vinci-S robotic surgical system was used and outcomes were evaluated retrospectively. Mean age of the patients was 52.3\xa0±\xa06.5 years. Mean tumor size was 3.1\xa0±\xa01.0 (1.4-6.6)\xa0cm. R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry and PADUA scores were 6.0\xa0±\xa01.5 and 7.5\xa0±\xa00.9, respectively. Mean surgical time was 127.7\xa0±\xa018.7 minutes and estimated blood loss was 100\xa0±\xa018.1\xa0cc. Mean warm ischemia time was 16.0\xa0±\xa08.9 (0-30) minutes. Intraoperative complications did not develop in any patient. Median hospital stay was 3.0 (2-6) days. Except for 17 patients, hilar clamping was performed in 25 patients. Histopathology results included 34 renal cell carcinoma (22 clear cell, 7 chromophobe cell, 4 papillary cell, and 1 clear papillary cell). Oncocytoma (n\xa0=\xa04), adenoma (n\xa0=\xa01), fibroadipose tissue (n\xa0=\xa01), papillary epithelial hyperplasia (n\xa0=\xa01), and chronic pyelonephritis (n\xa0=\xa01) were present. Surgical margins were negative in all patients. During a median follow-up period of 15.5\xa0±\xa010.9 (3-46) months, neither local recurrence nor distant metastasis was detected. In conclusion, RAPN is a safe, minimally invasive surgical approach, with excellent surgical and oncological outcomes in T1 kidney tumors. Zero ischemia off-clamp RAPN is also safe in selected masses with the advantage of avoiding complete renal ischemia.']	('Ener', 'Kemal')	The Kaohsiung journal of medical sciences	Kaohsiung J. Med.

['Nephrotoxicity is the major dose-limiting toxicity of cisplatin (CDDP). The aim of this study was to develop a pharmacokinetic (PK)/toxicodynamic (TD) model of CDDP-induced acute renal injury in rats and to simulate nephrotoxicity at various dosing rates. CDDP was administered to rats by a 30-s bolus or a 2-h infusion (1.0, 2.5, 5.0, and 7.5 mg/kg). Unbound CDDP concentrations in plasma and urine were determined up to 2 h after administration in the PK study, and plasma creatinine (Cr) levels were monitored for up to 7 days as an index of nephrotoxicity in the TD study. The PK was linear and was fitted with a traditional 2-compartment model. The TD was nonlinear and differed between dosing rates. The creatinine concentration profiles were fitted with a signal transduction-indirect response model. Population analysis using a nonlinear mixed-effect model was adapted to the developed PK/TD model and was well-validated. Dosing simulations from the developed population PK/TD model indicated that CDDP-induced nephrotoxicity was due to not only Cmax but also the time above the toxic concentration of CDDP. Prolongation of infusion time will not necessarily attenuate acute nephrotoxicity. This study demonstrated the potential utility of PK/TD modeling for preventing nephrotoxicity.']	('Fukushima', 'Keizo')	Journal of pharmaceutical sciences	J Pharm Sci	['eng']

['Efficiency of mono-sialogangliosides to load Paclitaxel (Ptx) has recently been found to depend on the structure of the polysaccharide chain. In this study, we demonstrated that incorporation of only one more sialic acid into the ganglioside molecule, independently of its position, causes a 4-fold increase in Ptx-loading capacity, the maximum being at a 5:1 molar ratio (di-sialoganglioside/Paclitaxel, GD/Ptx). These complexes are stable in solution for at least 3 months, and over 90% of Ptx remains loaded in the micelles after extreme stress conditions such as high-speed centrifugation, lyophilization, or freeze-thaw cycles. Ganglioside micelles protect 50% of the initially loaded Ptx from alkaline hydrolysis after 24 h at pH 10. Dynamic light scattering studies revealed that GD micelles increase their size from 9 to 12 nm when loaded with Ptx. Transmission electron microscopy shows a homogeneous population of spherical micelles either with or without Ptx. In vitro biological activity was similar to that of the free drug. These results provide further options of self-assembled nanostructures of di- and tri-sialogangliosides with a higher loading capacity.']	('Heredia', 'Valeria')	Journal of pharmaceutical sciences	J Pharm Sci	['eng']

['Nanotechnology offers a targeted approach to both imaging and treatment of cancer, the leading cause of death worldwide. Previous studies have found that nanoparticles with a wide variety of coatings initiate an immune response leading to sequestration in the liver and spleen. In an effort to find a nanoparticle platform which does not elicit an immune response, we created 43 nm and 44 nm of gold and silver nanoparticles coated with biomolecules normally produced by the body, ?-lipoic acid and the epidermal growth factor (EGF), and have used mass spectroscopy to determine their biodistribution in mouse models, 24 h after tail vein injection. Relative to controls, mouse EGF (mEGF)-coated silver and gold nanoprobes are found at background levels in all organs including the liver and spleen. The lack of sequestration of mEGF-coated nanoprobes in the liver and spleen and the corresponding uptake of control nanoprobes at elevated levels in these organs suggest that the former are not recognized by the immune system. Further studies of cytokine and interleukin levels in the blood are required to confirm avoidance of an immune response.']	('Lee', 'Christopher L D')	Journal of pharmaceutical sciences	J Pharm Sci	['eng']

['There is evidence to show that downregulation of miR-1 expression is closely related to cancer progression, including in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). However, the molecular mechanisms underlying miR-1 downregulation in NPC remain largely unknown, especially its association with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). In this study we found that restoration of miR-1 dramatically inhibited cell invasion in vitro, together with tumour growth and metastasis in vivo. Importantly, we found that LMP1, an Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-associated protein, suppressed miR-1 expression. Furthermore, we identified K-ras as a novel direct target of miR-1. Our results demonstrated for the first time that miR-1 was suppressed by LMP1 and its tumour-suppressive effects were mediated chiefly by repressing K-ras expression. We propose that miR-1 could serve as an independent biomarker to identify patients with different clinical characteristics.']	('Chen', 'Xi')	International journal of experimental pathology	Int J Exp Pathol	['eng']
26852686	2015	01	Multiple pathways regulate Cten in colorectal cancer without a Tensin switch.	['CTEN/TNS4 is a member of the Tensin gene family. It localizes to focal adhesions and induces cell motility. The mechanisms regulating Cten expression are unclear although we have shown regulation by Kras in the colon and pancreas. In normal mammary cell lines, it is reportedly upregulated by epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and STAT3 signalling and upregulation is accompanied by downregulation of Tensin 3 (Tensin switch). In this study, we investigated the roles of EGFR and STAT3 signalling in the regulation of Cten in colorectal cancer (CRC). In addition, we investigated calpain--a regulator of focal adhesion-associated proteins whose relevance to Cten has not been investigated. CRC cell lines were stimulated with epidermal growth factor (EGF). This resulted in an increase in Cten and Tensin 3 protein. Kras was knocked down and this resulted in downregulation of Cten and Tensin 3. We next investigated the role of STAT3 signalling. Activation and knockdown of STAT3 resulted in downregulation and upregulation, respectively, of Cten. Inhibition of calpain resulted in upregulation of both Cten and Tensin 3. As the regulators of Cten also seemed to regulate Tensin 3, we tested the interaction between Cten and Tensin 3. Cten was forcibly expressed or knocked down resulting, respectively, in upregulation and downregulation of Tensin 3. We conclude that in CRC, Cten is upregulated by EGFR and Kras but downregulated by STAT3. We show that calpain may be a negative regulator of Cten and that a Tensin switch does not occur and, if anything, Cten stabilizes Tensin 3.']	('Thorpe', 'Hannah')	International journal of experimental pathology	Int J Exp Pathol	['eng']

This study tests the possible correlation of cellular expression of CD135 and CD117 with somatic gene mutations in T-ALL. One hundred sixty-two samples were tested, including 143 at diagnosis, 15 from T-lymphoblastic lymphoma at relapse, and four relapse samples from sequential follow-up of T-ALL. CD135 and CD117 monoclonal antibodies were included in the T-ALL panel of flow cytometry. The percentage of cells positivity and the median fluorescence intensity were correlated with gene mutational status. STIL-TAL1, TLX3, FLT3 and IL7R mutations were tested using standard techniques. STIL-TAL1 was found in 24.8%, TLX3 in 12%, IL7R in 10% and FLT3-ITD in 5% of cases. FLT3 and IL7R mutations were mutually exclusive, as were FLT3-ITD and STIL-TAL1.

['Early detection of breast cancer is desirable to prevent progression to advanced disease. This subject has been one of significant study and debate for women at normal risk, and recommendations continue to evolve. However, with regard to women at high risk, the recommendations from various health care professional organizations, including the recent recommendations from the United States Preventative Services Task Force, are different and also inconsistent concerning when to begin screening and which modalities should be used. We review several randomized controlled trials and consensus opinions regarding when to begin screening for breast cancer and how to best screen women at high risk. Specifically, we address women with known personal history of breast cancer, prior mantle radiation, or specific family history (including genetic family history) of breast cancer. The purpose of this inquiry is to present current evidence and suggest a clinical pathway regarding the screening of women at high risk for breast cancer.']	('Jatala', 'Summer')	Journal of patient-centered research and reviews	J Patient Cent Res Rev	['eng']

Previous studies suggest that water intake suppresses plasma levels of AVP, and high levels of AVP have been suggested to play deleterious roles in animal models of kidney disease. Moreover, recent epidemic of CKD of unknown origin, which was supposed to be related to the insufficient water intake and chronic volume depletion, has been reported in Central America, further suggesting that the suppression of AVP by sustained water intake might be beneficial in this CKD population.

Cancers of reproductive organs with breast cancer are responsible for the highest morbidity and mortality in women suffering from neoplasm diseases. Asymptomatic dynamics of the development of a neoplasm and no deviations from the normal level of laboratory results contribute to the fact that malignant diseases are diagnosed too late.

Cellular interactions play the main role in the development, angiogenesis and invasiveness of a tumor. Recent research suggests the possibility of microvesicles (MVs) involvement in communication between cells. The MVs ability to fuse with various cells is used in cell-to-cell contact. Microvesicles cargo may include growth factors, their receptors, protease, adhesion molecules, signaling molecules and the sequence of DNA, mRNA, and micro-RNA. Larger quantities of MVs released from neoplastic cells affect both the local environment and systematic range causing metastases and progression.

['For the last decades, hundreds of potential serum biomarkers have been assessed in diagnosing of ovarian cancer including the wide spectrum of cytokines, growth factors, adhesion molecules, proteases, hormones, coagulation factors, acute phase reactants, and apoptosis factors but except CA125 none of them have been applied to everyday clinical practice. Nowadays, the growing number of evidence suggests that the classic marker CA125 should be accompanied by HE4 and in fact, Risk of Ovarian Malignancy Algorithm (ROMA) is becoming more and more widespread in clinical practice for the evaluation of adnexal masses. Early ovarian cancer is often asymptomatic, so the challenge still exists to develop serum markers suitable for early diagnosis and screening. Current knowledge strongly points to different mechanisms of pathogenesis, genetic disturbances and clinical course of major histological subtypes of ovarian cancer. Thus, future biomarker/multimarker panels should take into consideration the implications of different molecular patterns and biological behavior of various subtypes of ovarian cancer. Very promising are studies on miRNAs - small non-protein coding gene-regulatory RNA molecules functionally involved in the pathogenesis of cancers acting as oncogenes (oncomirs) or tumor suppressors. The studies devoted to ovarian cancer tissue miRNA profiling have shown that miRNAs could be useful in diagnosing and predicting the OC outcome. They also confirmed that OC is a highly heterogeneous disease, gathering four distinct histological tumor subtypes characterized not only by distinct origin, behavior and response to chemotherapy but also by different patterns of miRNA expression.']	('Nowak', 'Marek')	Przeglad menopauzalny = Menopause review	Prz Menopauzalny	['eng']

26847816	2016	12	Multiple Myeloma in Pregnancy--A Review of the Literature and a Case Series.	['Multiple myeloma (MM) typically affects older patients with a median age at diagnosis of 67 to 70 years and only 3% of cases are diagnosed before the age of 40. Moreover, MM is more common in men. Therefore, pregnancy rarely occurs in patients with MM and only 37 cases of MM in pregnancy have been reported in the literature. Herein we report an additional 5 cases. The diagnosis of MM might be problematic in this context because some of the symptoms and signs, such as back pain and anemia, can be attributed to pregnancy. Furthermore, if the patient wishes to continue her pregnancy, therapeutic options are currently limited. The list of agents that can be safely administered in pregnant women includes glucocorticoids. Moreover, any continuation of pregnancy has obvious long-term psychosocial repercussions for the patient and her family because of the currently incurable nature of MM. The reported cases of MM in pregnancy represent a spectrum of clinical manifestations. The selection of efficacious and safe treatments is challenging, especially if continuation of pregnancy is desired. Although some authors postulate that pregnancy might lead to progression of MM, data are limited and no consensus on this point has been reached.']	('Jurczyszyn', 'Artur')	Clinical lymphoma, myeloma & leukemia	Clin Lymphoma Myeloma Leuk	['eng']

['Extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) is the most common subtype of marginal zone lymphoma (MZL), with stomach being the most frequent primary site, followed by salivary gland, lung and ocular adnexa. Although clinically indolent, MALT lymphoma has the potential of local recurrence and systemic spread. Amyloid deposition is a very unusual complication of MALT lymphoma. In this study, we report clinicopathologic features of 5 cases of MALT lymphomas with associated amyloid deposits. One case showed amyloid deposits in the primary lesion; the other four cases showed amyloid deposits only in recurrences. Previous studies suggest that the amyloid deposits do not implicate worse prognosis. In our study, although amyloid deposits were focal and organ confined, one patient had extensive deposits of amyloid in the large bowel wall leading to bowel perforation and another patient developed significant peripheral neuropathy due to amyloid deposits in the brachial plexus. In conclusion, amyloid deposits in MALT lymphomas are rare and organ/tumour confined. However, complications can be critical and cause considerable morbidity. Therefore, pathologists should be aware of the association between MALT lymphoma and amyloid deposition, and clinical follow up is warranted.']	('Zhang', 'Qi')	Pathology, research and practice	Pathol.

['Epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR TKI) monotherapy has been regarded as the standard first-line treatment of advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in patients with sensitive epidermal growth factor receptor gene (EGFR) mutations. Acquired resistance is inevitable, however, which presents a challenge in the management of patients with such mutations. Here, we summarize the clinical evidence on treatment strategies for both EGFR TKI-naive and acquired EGFR TKI-resistant NSCLC. We reviewed the published literature and abstracts of oral and poster presentations from international conferences addressing treatment strategies that are in use or in clinical development to improve the survival of patients who are EGFR TKI naive and EGFR TKI resistant. Various strategies have been explored to manage EGFR TKI resistance with the aim of prolonging the survival of patients with EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Combination strategies in the first-line treatment have been studied most to improve the benefit from EGFR TKI monotherapy and delay the occurrence of resistance. After failure of EGFR TKI monotherapy, continuation of EGFR TKI therapy combined with chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted agents has been used to overcome the development of resistance. In addition, novel compounds designed to act on specific targets associated with EGFR TKI resistance have been in continued clinical development. Treatment regimens that are superior to EGFR TKI monotherapy in the first-line or to overcome acquired EGFR TKI resistance in patients with NSCLC and EGFR mutations still need to be developed. Results of ongoing studies will provide more insight into effective treatment strategies for patients with EGFR mutations.']	('Zhou', 'Caicun')	Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer	J Thorac Oncol	['eng']

26844286	2015	11	Are Clade Specific HIV Vaccines a Necessity? An Analysis Based on Mathematical Models.	['As HIV-1 envelope immune responses are critical to vaccine related protection, most candidate HIV vaccines entering efficacy trials are based upon a clade specific design. This need for clade specific vaccine prototypes markedly reduces the implementation of potentially effective HIV vaccines. We utilized a mathematical model to determine the effectiveness of immediate roll-out of a non-clade matched vaccine with reduced efficacy compared to constructing clade specific vaccines, which would take considerable time to manufacture and test in safety and efficacy trials. We simulated the HIV epidemic in San Francisco (SF) and South Africa (SA) and projected effectiveness of three vaccination strategies: i) immediate intervention with a 20-40% vaccine efficacy (VE) non-matched vaccine, ii) delayed intervention by developing a 50% VE clade-specific vaccine, and iii) immediate intervention with a non-matched vaccine replaced by a clade-specific vaccine when developed. Immediate vaccination with a non-clade matched vaccine, even with reduced efficacy, would prevent thousands of new infections in SF and millions in SA over 30 years. Vaccination with 50% VE delayed for five years needs six and 12 years in SA to break-even with immediate 20 and 30% VE vaccination, respectively, while not able to surpass the impact of immediate 40% VE vaccination over 30 years. Replacing a 30% VE with a 50% VE vaccine after 5 years reduces the HIV acquisition by 5% compared to delayed vaccination. The immediate use of an HIV vaccine with reduced VE in high risk communities appears desirable over a short time line but higher VE should be the pursued to achieve strong long-term impact. Our analysis illustrates the importance of developing surrogate markers (correlates of protection) to allow bridging types of immunogenicity studies to support more rapid assessment of clade specific vaccines.']	('Dimitrov', 'Dobromir')	EBioMedicine	EBioMedicine	['eng']
26844285	2015	11	Lansoprazole Upregulates Polyubiquitination of the TNF Receptor-Associated Factor 6 and Facilitates Runx2-mediated Osteoblastogenesis.	['The transcription factor, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), plays a pivotal role in the differentiation of the mesenchymal stem cells to the osteochondroblast lineages. We found by the drug repositioning strategy that a proton pump inhibitor, lansoprazole, enhances nuclear accumulation of Runx2 and induces osteoblastogenesis of human mesenchymal stromal cells. Systemic administration of lansoprazole to a rat femoral fracture model increased osteoblastogenesis. Dissection of signaling pathways revealed that lansoprazole activates a noncanonical bone morphogenic protein (BMP)-transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-?) activated kinase-1 (TAK1)-p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. We found by in cellulo ubiquitination studies that lansoprazole enhances polyubiquitination of the TNF receptor-associated factor 6 (TRAF6) and by in vitro ubiquitination studies that the enhanced polyubiquitination of TRAF6 is attributed to the blocking of a deubiquitination enzyme, cylindromatosis (CYLD). Structural modeling and site-directed mutagenesis of CYLD demonstrated that lansoprazole tightly fits in a pocket of CYLD where the C-terminal tail of ubiquitin lies. Lansoprazole is a potential therapeutic agent for enhancing osteoblastic differentiation.']	('Mishima', 'Kenichi')	EBioMedicine	EBioMedicine	['eng']

26844273	2015	11	PP2AC Level Determines Differential Programming of p38-TSC-mTOR Signaling and Therapeutic Response to p38-Targeted Therapy in Colorectal Cancer.	['The p38 MAP kinase is a promising cancer drug target but its therapeutic effect is not fully understood. Here we report that the response of colorectal cancer (CRC) to p38 inhibitors (p38i) is highly variable: while p38i induces regression of one subgroup of CRCs, it stimulates growth of another subgroup. We further show that PP2AC is differentially expressed in the two different CRC subgroups, which determines the programing of p38-TSC-mTORC1 signaling through differential TSC2 phosphorylation at S664, 1254 and 1798, and the antitumor activity by p38i. Remarkably, modulation of PP2AC level is sufficient to reprogram p38-to-mTORC1 signaling and antitumor response. PP2AC expression accurately predicts therapeutic response to p38i in several CRC models, including a large cohort of patient-derived xenografts (PDXs). Moreover, we demonstrate that combination of p38 and mTOR kinase inhibitors effectively overcomes resistance to either inhibitor in single agent therapy. These results demonstrate that alternative routing of signal transduction underlies differential response to p38 and mTOR targeted therapies. The biomarker-guided therapeutic strategies described herein provide a compelling reason for testing in metastatic CRC patients who suffer very poor prognosis due to lack of efficacious drug therapies.']	('Zhang', 'Yanjie')	EBioMedicine	EBioMedicine	['eng']

['BCL9/9L proteins enhance the transcriptional output of the ?-catenin/TCF transcriptional complex and contribute critically to upholding the high WNT signaling level required for stemness maintenance in the intestinal epithelium. Here we show that a BCL9/9L-dependent gene signature derived from independent mouse colorectal cancer (CRC) models unprecedentedly separates patient subgroups with regard to progression free and overall survival. We found that this effect was by and large attributable to stemness related gene sets. Remarkably, this signature proved associated with recently described poor prognosis CRC subtypes exhibiting high stemness and/or epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) traits. Consistent with the notion that high WNT signaling is required for stemness maintenance, ablating Bcl9/9l-?-catenin in murine oncogenic intestinal organoids provoked their differentiation and completely abrogated their tumorigenicity, while not affecting their proliferation. Therapeutic strategies aimed at targeting WNT responses may be limited by intestinal toxicity. Our findings suggest that attenuating WNT signaling to an extent that affects stemness maintenance without disturbing intestinal renewal might be well tolerated and prove sufficient to reduce CRC recurrence and dramatically improve disease outcome.']	('Moor', 'Andreas E')	EBioMedicine	EBioMedicine	['eng']

Therefore, we must find alternative approaches to target MYC-driven cancers. Amplification of MYCN, a MYC family member, predicts high-risk neuroblastoma (NB) disease. We have shown that R9-caPep blocks the interaction of PCNA with its binding partners and selectively kills human NB cells, especially those with MYCN amplification, and we now show the mechanism. We found elevated levels of DNA replication stress in MYCN-amplified NB cells. R9-caPep exacerbated DNA replication stress in MYCN-amplified NB cells and NB cells with an augmented level of MYC by interfering with DNA replication fork extension, leading to Chk1 dependence and susceptibility to Chk1 inhibition.

Most studies were performed in universities and sponsored by university/organization, industry or individual researchers. Inclusion of adults from both genders predominated. The median number of participants per study in the three registries ranged between 63 and 155. The conditions researched differed among the three registries and study purpose was mostly treatment followed by prevention. Endpoints were mostly efficacy followed by safety.

Observational studies were mostly prospective and cohort studies. Most CTs were phase 3 and tested drugs or procedures. Parallel group assignment and random allocation predominated. Blinding was implemented in many of trials and was mostly double-blind.

26843908	2016	12	Cell Line-Dependent Variability of Coordinate Expression of p75NTR and CRABP1 and Modulation of Effects of Fenretinide on Neuroblastoma Cells.	['Neuroblastoma is a childhood neural crest tumor. Fenretinide, a retinoic acid analogue, induces accumulation of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species and consequent apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. The p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75NTR) enhances the antineuroblastoma cell efficacy of fenretinide in vitro. We examined the role of the retinoid binding protein, CRABP1, in p75NTR-mediated potentiation of the efficacy of fenretinide. Knockdown and overexpression, respectively, of either p75NTR or CRABP1 were effected in neuroblastoma cell lines using standard techniques. Expression was determined by qRT-PCR and confirmed at the protein level by Western blot. Metabolic viability was determined by Alamar blue assay. While protein content of CRABP1 correlated roughly with that of p75NTR in the three neuroblastoid or epithelioid human neuroblastoma cell lines studied, manipulation of p75NTR expression resulted in cell line-dependent, variable change in CRABP1 expression. Furthermore, in some cell lines, induced expression of CRABP1 in the absence of p75NTR did not alter cell sensitivity to fenretinide treatment. The effects of manipulation of p75NTR expression on CRABP1 expression and the effects of CRABP1 expression on fenretinide efficacy are therefore neuroblastoma cell line-dependent. Potentiation of the antineuroblastoma cell effects of fenretinide by p75NTR is not mediated solely through CRABP1.']	('Yang', 'Yaoli Pu')	Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity	Oxid Med Cell Longev	['eng']

PCORI's national priorities span five broad domains: person-centered outcomes research, health disparities research, healthcare systems research, communication and dissemination research, and methodologic research. As these national priorities overlap with the knowledge and skills often emphasized in psychology training programs, initiatives by training programs to bolster strengths in these domains could place trainees at the forefront of this emerging research paradigm. As a part of a new Masters program in behavioral health, our program developed a health psychology course modeled around PCORI's five national priorities, and an initial evaluation in a small sample supported student learning in the five PCORI domains. In summary, the current report has implications for familiarizing readers with PCORI's national priorities for U.S. healthcare, stimulating debate surrounding psychology's response to the largest healthcare paradigm shift in recent U.S. history, and providing a working model for programs seeking to implement PCORI-related changes to their curricula.""]"	('Hoerger', 'Michael')	Training and education in professional psychology	Train Educ Prof Psychol	['eng']

Methylation of CpG-rich 5' regions was assessed by bisulfite sequencing PCR using bisulfite-treated DNA from archival microdissected paraffin-embedded adrenocortical tissues. Three normal adrenals and 23 various adrenocortical tumor samples (15 adenomas and 8 carcinomas) were studied. Methylation in the promoter region of VDR gene was found in 3/8 ACCs, while no VDR gene methylation was observed in normal adrenals and adrenocortical adenomas. VDR mRNA and protein levels were lower in ACCs than in benign tumors, and VDR immunostaining was weak or negative in ACCs, including all 3 methylated tissue samples. The association between VDR gene promoter methylation and reduced VDR gene expression is not a rare event in ACC, suggesting that VDR epigenetic inactivation may have a role in adrenocortical carcinogenesis.""]"	('Pilon', 'Catia')	International journal of endocrinology	Int J Endocrinol	['eng']

['Epigenetics is a branch of science that focuses on mechanisms related to control and modification of expression of genetic material without any changes to its sequences. Such mechanisms include post-translational modifications of histones. It is widely known that carcinogenesis is related to hypoacetylation of genes that influence apoptosis, the cell cycle, cell signaling, the immunologic response, angiogenesis and occurrence of metastasis. Currently conducted research focuses on several strategies related to epigenetic therapy. One such strategy is based on the use of histone deacetylase inhibitors. This paper presents mechanisms through which these compounds work and a summary of their characteristics. It also includes a review of clinical tests related to histone deacetylase inhibitors, as well as their relationship with other chemotherapeutic methods.

['Taxanes, a group of cancer drugs that includes docetaxel and paclitaxel, have become a front-line therapy for a variety of metastatic cancers, but resistance can develop. There are several docetaxel resistance mechanisms in prostate cancer: unfavorable tumor microenvironment, drug efflux pump, alterations in microtubule structure and/or function, and apoptotic defects (e.g. up regulation of Bcl-2 and clusterin or activation of the PTEN/PI3K/mTOR pathway or activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway). MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small regulatory molecules, could also function as a contributor to the resistance of cancer cells to commonly used anti-cancer drugs. Aberrant expressions of miRNAs that can act as tumor suppressors or oncogenes are closely associated with the development, invasion and metastasis of various cancers including prostate cancer. Nearly 50 miRNAs have been reported to be differentially expressed in human prostate cancer so far, but knowledge concerning the effects of miRNAs on the sensitivity to anti-cancer drugs is still limited. The author of the review focus on probable impact of miRNAs on the resistance to docetaxel and paclitaxel. Overexpression of miR-21 increased the resistance of prostate cancer cells to docetaxel by targeting PDCD4, PTEN, RECK, and BTG2. Nevertheless, decreased expressions of tumor suppressors: miR-34a, miR-143, miR-148a and miR-200 family are involved in resistance of anti-cancer drugs by inhibition of apoptosis and activation of signaling pathways.

The current study was therefore carried out to address the issue if Gaillardin is able to induce apoptosis in the breast cancer cell lines MCF-7 and MDA-MB-468 and to determine the underlying mechanism of its anticancer effects. Apoptosis induction by Gaillardin treatment was confirmed by annexin V-FITC/PI staining, and caspase-3,-6, and-9 activation. Using Western blot analysis, we found that Gaillardin upregulated the pro-apoptotic protein Bax and p53 and downregulated the anti-apoptotic protein Bcl-2. Moreover, the apoptotic effect of Gaillardin was also related to ROS production and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (??m).

26841412	2016	12	Graphical Features of Functional Genes in Human Protein Interaction Network.	['With the completion of the human genome project, it is feasible to investigate large-scale human protein interaction network (HPIN) with complex networks theory. Proteins are encoded by genes. Essential, viable, disease, conserved, housekeeping (HK) and tissue-enriched (TE) genes are functional genes, which are organized and functioned via interaction networks. Based on up-to-date data from various databases or literature, two large-scale HPINs and six subnetworks are constructed. We illustrate that the HPINs and most of the subnetworks are sparse, small-world, scale-free, disassortative and with hierarchical modularity. Among the six subnetworks, essential, disease and HK subnetworks are more densely connected than the others. Statistical analysis on the topological structures of the HPIN reveals that the lethal, the conserved, the HK and the TE genes are with hallmark graphical features. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves indicate that the essential genes can be distinguished from the viable ones with accuracy as high as almost 70%. Closeness, semi-local and eigenvector centralities can distinguish the HK genes from the TE ones with accuracy around 82%.

['The main metabolism pathway of tryptophan is protein formation, but it can also be metabolized into serotonin and kynurenine. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) is the enzyme that catalyzes the degradation of tryptophan into kynurenine. Mastocytosis is a heterogeneous disease characterized by mast cell accumulation in various tissues with 57% of patients having gastrointestinal involvement. We studied tryptophan metabolism in mastocytosis patients displaying or not gastrointestinal features and healthy subjects (n = 26 in each group). Mastocytosis patients with digestive symptoms displayed significantly increased kynurenine level and IDO activity as compared to healthy controls and mastocytosis patients without digestive symptoms. This could be linked to mast cell-mediated digestive inflammation among patients with mastocytosis. This work is the first focusing on kynurenine pathway in a mast cell disease and could help to understand the pathogenesis of digestive features in mastocytosis as well as in other mast cell-mediated diseases.']	('Georgin-Lavialle', 'S')	Allergy	Allergy	['eng']

['We propose an architecture with a remote phosphor-based modular and compact light-emitting diode (LED) light source in a noncontact dermoscope prototype for skin cancer screening. The spectrum and color temperature of the output light can easily and significantly be changed depending on spectral absorption characteristics of the tissues being imaged. The new system has several advantages compared to state-of-the-art phosphor converted ultrabright white LEDs, used in a wide range of medical imaging devices, which have a fixed spectrum and color temperature at a given operating point. In particular, the system can more easily be adapted to the requirements originating from different tissues in the human body, which have wavelength-dependent absorption and reflectivity. This leads to improved contrast for different kinds of imaged tissue components. The concept of such a lighting architecture can be vastly utilized in many other medical imaging devices including endoscopic systems.']	('Basu', 'Chandrajit')	Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)

['This paper presents an imaging-genomic pipeline to derive three-dimensional intra-tumor heterogeneity features from contrast-enhanced CT images and correlates them with gene mutation status. The pipeline has been demonstrated using CT scans of patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas. About 15% of ccRCC cases reported have BRCA1-associated protein 1 (BAP1) gene alterations that are associated with high tumor grade and poor prognosis. We hypothesized that BAP1 mutation status can be detected using computationally derived image features. The molecular data pertaining to gene mutation status were obtained from the cBioPortal. Correlation of the image features with gene mutation status was assessed using the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank-sum test. We also used the random forests classifier in the Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis software to assess the predictive ability of the computationally derived image features to discriminate cases with BAP1 mutations for ccRCC. Receiver operating characteristics were obtained using a leave-one-out-cross-validation procedure. Our results show that our model can predict BAP1 mutation status with a high degree of sensitivity and specificity. This framework demonstrates a methodology for noninvasive disease biomarker detection from contrast-enhanced CT images.']	('Ghosh', 'Payel')	Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)

['C-type lectin receptors (CLRs) on antigen-presenting cells (APCs) facilitate uptake of carbohydrate antigens for antigen presentation, modulating the immune response in infection, homeostasis, autoimmunity, allergy, and cancer. In this review, we focus on the role of the macrophage galactose type C-type lectin (MGL) in the immune response against self-antigens, pathogens, and tumor associated antigens (TAA). MGL is a CLR exclusively expressed by dendritic cells (DCs) and activated macrophages (MØs), able to recognize terminal GalNAc residues, including the sialylated and nonsialylated Tn antigens. We discuss the effects on DC function induced throughout the engagement of MGL, highlighting the importance of the antigen structure in the modulation of immune response. Indeed modifying Tn-density, the length, and steric structure of the Tn-antigens can result in generating immunogens that can efficiently bind to MGL, strongly activate DCs, mimic the effects of a danger signal, and achieve an efficient presentation in HLA classes I and II compartments.']	('Zizzari', 'Ilaria Grazia')	Journal of immunology research	J Immunol Res	['eng']

['Here, we report a case of stromal tumor of uncertain malignant potential (STUMP) that was difficult to diagnose. A 53-year-old male was found to have a hard nodule on digital rectal examination; magnetic resonance imaging revealed a large nodule on the left side of the prostate, indicating prostate cancer. However, pathological diagnosis of the biopsy specimen was benign prostatic hyperplasia. Although a papillary tumor in the prostatic urethra was also seen on urethrocystoscopy, the tumor specimen obtained from transurethral resection was not malignant. The tumor in the prostatic urethra recurred only 3 months after transurethral resection, and pathological findings revealed benign hyperplasia not only in the stromal tissue but also in the epithelium; therefore, the prostate tumor was suspected to be STUMP. It took many prostate pathologists a long time to reach the final diagnosis of STUMP. STUMP is a rare benign tumor, difficult to diagnose, and sometimes transforms into stromal sarcoma.

['Messenger RNA data of lymphohematopoietic cancer lines suggest a correlation between expression of the cation channel TRPM2 and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. The latter is overexpressed in various tumor entities and mediates therapy resistance. Here, we analyzed the crosstalk between Bcl-2 and TRPM2 channels in T cell leukemia cells during oxidative stress as conferred by ionizing radiation (IR). To this end, the effects of TRPM2 inhibition or knock-down on plasma membrane currents, Ca(2+) signaling, mitochondrial superoxide anion formation, and cell cycle progression were compared between irradiated (0-10\u2009Gy) Bcl-2-overexpressing and empty vector-transfected Jurkat cells. As a result, IR stimulated a TRPM2-mediated Ca(2+)-entry, which was higher in Bcl-2-overexpressing than in control cells and which contributed to IR-induced G2/M cell cycle arrest. TRPM2 inhibition induced a release from G2/M arrest resulting in cell death. Collectively, this data suggests a pivotal function of TRPM2 in the DNA damage response of T cell leukemia cells. Apoptosis-resistant Bcl-2-overexpressing cells even can afford higher TRPM2 activity without risking a hazardous Ca(2+)-overload-induced mitochondrial superoxide anion formation.']	('Klumpp', 'Dominik')	Oxidative medicine and cellular longevity	Oxid Med Cell Longev	['eng']

A 9-item pretested questionnaire contains questions on oral examination, oral cancer risk factors, and requests for further information. Descriptive statistics were conducted using chi-square testing. Results. The response rate of the study was 70.3% (114/162), with 26 (22.8%) males and 88 (77.2%) females. All undergraduate dental students were familiar with examining the oral mucosa of their patients and most were likely to advise patients about the risk factors for developing oral cancer (98.2%). Nearly one-third (32.4%) of students reported examining patients with oral lesions as early signs for oral cancer (P < 0.001) and nearly 70% agreed that they did not have sufficient knowledge regarding the prevention and detection of oral cancer (P < 0.001). In addition, more than 95.6% agreed that there is a need for additional information/teaching regarding oral cancer. Further, 61.3% and 14.1% identified tobacco smoking and drinking alcohol as major risk factors for developing oral cancer. Conclusion.

Decrease in mDCs in the front and in the main tumor mass was observed. The increase in the number of mDCs in both of these locations was associated with the presence of metastases in the nearby lymph nodes (p < 0.05 and p < 0.01). Furthermore, the increase in the proportion of mDCs in the main tumor mass was associated with the presence of the invasion of tumor cells into the blood and lymph vessels (p < 0.01).

Nanomaterial properties, such as increased surface area, have aided with signal amplification and lower detection limits. This review focuses on application of nanomaterials as signal amplification elements on origami paper-based electro-analytical devices for immune biomarkers detection with a brief introduction about various fabrication techniques and designs, biological and detection methods. In this review, we comprehensively summarize the selected latest research articles from 2013 to May 2015 on application of nanomaterials in various types of origami paper based electrochemical and photoelectrochemical immunosensors. The review breaks into two parts. The first part devotes to the development and applications of nanomaterials in electrochemical immunesensing.

"['In this study, we have described the biosynthesis of biocompatible gold nanoparticles (GNPs) from aqueous extract of the aerial parts of a pteridophyte, ""Adiantum philippense"" by microwave irradiation and its surface functionalization with broad spectrum beta lactam antibiotic, amoxicillin (Amox). The functionalization of amoxicillin on GNPs (GNP-Amox) was carried out via electrostatic interaction of protonated amino group and thioether moiety mediated attractive forces. The synthesized GNPs and GNP-Amox were physicochemically characterized. UV-Vis spectroscopy, Zeta potential, XRD, FTIR and SERS (surface enhanced raman spectra) results confirmed the loading of Amox into GNPs. Loading of Amox to GNPs reduce amoxicillin cytotoxicity, whereas GNPs were found to be nontoxic to mouse fibroblast cell line (L929) as evident from MTT and acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EtBr) live/dead cell assays. The GNP-Amox conjugates demonstrated enhanced broad-spectrum bactericidal activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Furthermore, in-vitro and in-vivo assays of GNP-Amox revealed potent anti-MRSA activity and improved the survival rate. This indicates the subversion of antibiotic resistance mechanism by overcoming the effect of high levels of ?-lactamase produced by methicillin resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Taken together, this study demonstrates the positive attributes from GNP-Amox conjugates as a promising antibacterial therapeutic agent against MRSA as well as other pathogens.']"	('Kalita', 'Sanjeeb')	Materials science & engineering.

26838879	2016	12	Porous biodegradable EW62 medical implants resist tumor cell growth.	['Magnesium alloys have been widely investigated for biodegradable medical applications. However, the shielding of harmful cells (eg. bacteria or tumorous cells) from immune surveillance may be compounded by the increased porosity of biodegradable materials. We previously demonstrated the improved corrosion resistance and mechanical properties of a novel EW62 (Mg-6%Nd-2%Y-0.5%Zr)) magnesium alloy by rapid solidification followed by extrusion (RS) compared to its conventional counterpart (CC). The present in vitro study evaluated the influence of rapid solidification on cytotoxicity to murine osteosarcoma cells. We found that CC and RS corrosion extracts significantly reduced cell viability over a 24-h exposure period. Cell density was reduced over 48 h following direct contact on both CC and RS surfaces, but was further reduced on the CC surface. The direct presence of cells accelerated corrosion for both materials. The corroded RS material exhibited superior mechanical properties relative to the CC material. The data show that the improved corrosion resistance of the rapidly solidified EW62 alloy (RS) resulted in a relatively reduced cytotoxic effect on tumorous cells. Hence, the tested alloy in the form of a rapidly solidified substance may introduce a good balance between its biodegradation characteristics and cytotoxic effect towards cancerous and normal cells.']	('Hakimi', 'O')	Materials science & engineering.

['Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is the most prevalent form of malignancy in southeast China and its development is meticulously related to EBV pathogenesis. The current screening techniques are unsatisfactory in terms of the sensitivity and hence most of the NPC patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage. Herein, we report the multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) combined with iron oxide nanoparticles as a sensing surface for the early screening of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) by immuno-PCR (iPCR). The MWCNT-Fe3O4 nanocomposite was characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectra (FTIR), Raman spectra, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). The characterization techniques had confirmed the successful formation of MWCNT-Fe3O4 nanocomposites. The MWCNT-Fe3O4-based iPCR was effectively tested for the quantification of anti-EBV antibodies in human serum and the limit of detection (LOD) was compared with ELISA. The limit of detection by iPCR was valid until 1:10,000,000 fold dilution of NPC(+ve) human serum, whereas ELISA can detect the anti-EBV antibodies in human serum up to 1:100,000 fold dilution. The MWCNT-Fe3O4 offers an excellent surface area for the antigen-antibody binding and hence greater sensitivity was achieved.']	('Chia-Ching', 'Liu')	Materials science & engineering.

26838862	2016	12	Streptavidin-modified monodispersed magnetic poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) microspheres as solid support in DNA-based molecular protocols.	['Molecular diagnostics may provide tailored and cost efficient treatment for infectious disease and cancer. Rolling circle amplification (RCA) of padlock probes guarantees high specificity to identify nucleic acid targets down to single nucleotide resolution in a multiplex fashion. This makes the assay suitable for molecular analysis of various diseases, and interesting to integrate into automated devices for point-of-care analysis. A critical prerequisite for many molecular assays is (i) target-specific isolation from complex clinical samples and (ii) removal of reagents, inhibitors and contaminants between reaction steps. Efficient solid supports are therefore essential to enable multi-step, multi-analyte protocols. Superparamagnetic micro- and nanoparticles, with large surface area and rapid liquid-phase kinetics, are attractive for multi-step protocols. Recently, streptavidin-modified magnetic monodispersed poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (STV-mag.PHEMA) microspheres were developed by multiple swelling polymerization. They are easily separated by a magnet and exhibit low non-specific protein sorption. In this study, the performance and the binding efficiency of STV-mag.PHEMA was addressed by circle-to-circle amplification (C2CA). A lower number of RCA products were detected as compared to the gold standard Dynabeads. Nevertheless, this study was the first to successfully adapt STV-mag.PHEMA microspheres as solid support in a DNA-based protocol, which is an important finding. The STV-mag.PHEMA microspheres were larger with about 16 times less surface area as compared to the Dynabeads, which might partly explain the lower rolling circle product (RCP) count obtained. Further research is currently ongoing comparing particles of similar sizes and optimizing reaction conditions to establish their full utility in the field. Ultimately, low cost and versatile particles are a great resource to facilitate future clinical molecular diagnostics.']	('Salih', 'Tagrid')	Materials science & engineering.

26838851	2016	12	Zwitterionic pH/redox nanoparticles based on dextran as drug carriers for enhancing tumor intercellular uptake of doxorubicin.	['Zwitterionic nanoparticles have excellent serum stability. In this study, pH/redox responsive polymer was synthesized through a modification of dextran using succinic acid, followed by crosslinking with cystamine. The polymer could self-assemble into stable nanoparticles (NPs) in aqueous solution. The NPs carried certain amount of free carboxyl and amino groups on the surface, which endowed the NPs excellent anti-protein adsorption ability. The surface charge was negative at pH7.4 and was converted to positive at pH5.0. It was revealed that the NPs showed little non-specific protein adsorption and had excellent serum stability, and the NPs could be internalized in Hela cells rapidly. This result was ascribed to the charge reversible feature of the NPs. Doxorubicin (DOX) was loaded in the NPs for release studies in vitro. The DOX-loaded NPs exhibited obvious pH and reduction sensitivities in response to the environment in tumor cells due to the introduction of carboxyl groups, amino groups and disulfide bonds in the NPs. The NPs were biocompatible, biodegradable, and could be potentially applied as anticancer drug carriers for enhancement of tumor intercellular uptake of doxorubicin.']	('Wu', 'Luyan')	Materials science & engineering.

However, to construct one safe co-delivering system with higher drug loading and gene transfection efficiency for cancer therapy is still challenging.

Then the nanocarrier was used for hydrophobic docetaxel (DOC) and functional gene (TFPI-2 plasmid) co-delivery to treat nasopharyngeal cancer (NPC). The results indicated that F127-PEI nanocarriers had higher DOC loading amount and possessed good gene delivery effect in vitro. For co-delivery analysis, the obtained F127-PEI/DOC/TFPI-2 complexes could induce a more significant apoptosis than DOC or TFPI-2 alone, and decreased invasive capacity of NPC HNE-1 cells more obviously. Moreover, the F127-PEI copolymer exhibited better blood compatibility and lower cytotoxicity compared to PEI-25k by the hemolysis and MTT assays, which suggests a promising potential for NPC therapy.']	('Liu', 'Tao')	Materials science & engineering.

['This work presents a new approach to fabrication and characterization of novel polymer nanofiber electrolytes from intercalated PVA/ODA-MMT nanocomposite as a matrix polymer and encapsulated graphene oxide (GO) nanosheets with amphiphilic reactive copolymer as partner polymers using electrospinning method. The chemical and physical structures, surface morphology, thermal behaviors and electric conductivity of nanocomposites and nanofibers were investigated using analyses methods including FTIR, XRD, SEM, DSC-TGA and conductivity analysis. Significant improvements in nanofiber morphology and size distribution were observed when GO and reactive organoclay were incorporated as reinforcement fillers into various matrix/partner solution blends. The structural factors of matrix-partner polymer nanocomposite particles with higher zeta-potential play important roles in both chemical and physical interfacial interactions and phase separation processing and also lead to the formation of nanofibers with unique surface morphologies and good conductivities. The cytotoxic, necrotic and apoptotic effects of chosen nanofibers on osteocarcinoma cells were also investigated. These multifunctional, self-assembled, nanofibrous surfaces can serve as semi-conductive and bioactive platforms in various electrochemical and bio-engineering processes, as well as reactive matrices used for the immobilization of various biopolymer precursors.']	('Rzayev', 'Zakir M O')	Materials science & engineering.

Particle size of the CuCSNPs was determined by using Zetasizer and the copper loading was quantified with the help of ICP/MS. Further characterization of CuCSNPs was carried out by FT-IR analysis to determine the formation of nanoparticles and SEM was conducted for the morphological analysis of the CuCSNPs. The CuCSNPs exhibited pronounced cytotoxic effects towards HEK-293 cells as analyzed by MTT assay. Moreover, the CuCSNPs inhibited the colony formation and induced nuclear damage at the dose of 100 ?g/mL, much more effectively than the in built control copper sulfate (CuSO4).

"[""Vincristine sulfate (VCS) is a drug of choice for the treatment of childhood and adult acute lymphocytic leukemia, Hodgkin's, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as well as solid tumors including sarcomas. However, poor biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic traits of VCS like short serum half-life (12 min), high dosing frequency (1.4 mg/m(2) per week for 4 weeks) and extensive protein binding (75%) limit the clinical potential of VCS in cancer therapy. In present investigation, injectable vincristine sulfate loaded dextran microspheres (VCS-Dextran-MSs) were prepared and amalgamated with chitosan-?-glycerophosphate gel (VCS-Dextran-MSs-Gel) to surmount the biopharmaceutical and pharmacokinetic limitations of VCS that consequently induced synergistic sustained release pattern of the drug. Particle size and zeta-potential of VCS-Dextran-MSs were measured to be 6.8 ± 2.4 ?m and -18.3 ± 0.11 mV along with the encapsulation efficiency of about 60.4 ± 4.5%. Furthermore, VCS-Dextran-MSs and VCS-Dextran-MSs-Gel exhibited slow release pattern and 94.7% and 95.8% of the drug was released in 72 h and 720 h, respectively. Results from cell viability assay and pharmacokinetic as well as histopathological analysis in mice indicated that VCS-Dextran-MSs-Gel offers superior therapeutic potential and higher AUClast than VCS-Dextran-MSs and drug solution.

['Fibrolamellar hepatocellular carcinoma (FL-HCC) is generally a fairly rare event in routine pathology practice. This variant of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is peculiarly intriguing and,in addition, poorly understood. Young people or children are often the target individuals with this type of cancer. Previously, I highlighted some pathology aspects of FL-HCC, but in this review, the distinctive clinico-pathologic features of FL-HCC and the diagnostic pathologic criteria of FL-HCC are fractionally reviewed and expanded upon. Further, molecular genetics update data with reference to this specific tumor are particularly highlighted as a primer for general pathologists and pediatric histopathologists. FL-HCC may present with metastases, and regional lymph nodes may be sites of metastatic spread. However, peritoneal and pulmonary metastatic foci have also been reported. To the best of our knowledge, FL-HCC was initially considered having an indolent course, but survival outcomes have recently been updated reconsidering the prognosis of this tumor. Patients seem to respond well to surgical resection, but recurrences are common. Thus, alternative therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation, are ongoing. Overall, it seems that this aspect has not been well-studied for this variant of HCC and should be considered as target for future clinical trials. Remarkably, FL-HCC data seem to point to a liver neoplasm of uncertain origin and unveiled outcome. A functional chimeric transcript incorporating DNAJB1 and PRKACA was recently added to FL-HCC. This sensational result may give remarkable insights into the understanding of this rare disease and potentially provide the basis for its specific diagnostic marker. Detection of DNAJB1-PRKACA seems to be, indeed, a very sensitive and specific finding in supporting the diagnosis of FL-HCC. In a quite diffuse opinion, prognosis of this tumor should be reconsidered following the potentially mandatory application of new molecular biological tools.']	('Sergi', 'Consolato M')	Diagnostics (Basel, Switzerland)	Diagnostics (Basel)	['eng']

26838385	2016	12	High resolution mass spectrometry coupled with multivariate data analysis revealing plasma lipidomic alteration in ovarian cancer in Asian women.	['Ovarian cancer (OC) is the most common cause of death from gynecologic malignancies in women. The identification of reliable diagnostic biomarkers for the early detection of this deadly disease is critical for reducing the mortality rate of OC. Plasma lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) levels were increased from OC patients vs. healthy controls. Therefore, lipidomics may represent an excellent developing prospect for the discovery of diagnostic biomarkers of OC. In this study, a nontargeted lipidomics approach based on ultra performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-QTOF-mass spectrometry (UPLC-ESI-QTOF-MS) combined with multivariate data analysis, including principal component analysis (PCA) and (orthogonal) partial least squared discriminant analysis [(O)PLS-DA] was applied for the investigation of potential diagnostic biomarkers in plasma of OC patients. Patients with OC could be distinguished from healthy individuals and patients with benign gynecological tumor disease by this method, which shows a significant lipid perturbation in this disease. With the assistance of high resolution and high accuracy of MS and MS/MS data, the potential markers including lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs), phosphatidylcholines (PCs) and triacylglycerols (TGs) with specific fatty acid chains, were identified. Interestingly, LPCs were up-regulated and PCs and TGs were down-regulated, compared OC group with benign tumor and normal control groups, and the glycerophospholipid metabolism emerged as a key pathway, in particular, the phospholipase A2 (PLA2) enzyme activity, that was disregulated in the disease. This study may provide new insight into underlying mechanisms for OC and proves that MS-based lipidomics is a powerful method in discovering new potential clinical biomarkers for diseases.']	('Zhang', 'Yangyang')	Talanta	Talanta	['eng']

26835512	2015	09	"HTLV-I Tax-Mediated Inactivation of Cell Cycle Checkpoints and DNA Repair Pathways Contribute to Cellular Transformation: ""A Random Mutagenesis Model""."	"['To achieve cellular transformation, most oncogenic retroviruses use transduction by proto-oncogene capture or insertional mutagenesis, whereby provirus integration disrupts expression of tumor suppressors or proto-oncogenes. In contrast, the Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-I) has been classified in a separate class referred to as ""transactivating retroviruses"". Current views suggest that the viral encoded Tax protein transactivates expression of cellular genes leading to deregulated growth and transformation. However, if Tax-mediated transactivation was indeed sufficient for cellular transformation, a fairly high frequency of infected cells would eventually become transformed. In contrast, the frequency of transformation by HTLV-I is very low, likely less than 5%. This review will discuss the current understanding and recent discoveries highlighting critical functions of Tax in cellular transformation. HTLV-I Tax carries out essential functions in order to override cell cycle checkpoints and deregulate cellular division. In addition, Tax expression is associated with increased DNA damage and genome instability. Since Tax can inhibit multiple DNA repair pathways and stimulate unfaithful DNA repair or bypass checkpoints, these processes allow accumulation of genetic mutations in the host genome. Given this, a ""Random Mutagenesis"" transformation model seems more suitable to characterize the oncogenic activities of HTLV-I.']"	('Nicot', 'Christophe')	Journal of cancer sciences	J Cancer Sci	['eng']

['Benign radiation-induced lung injury (RILI) is not uncommon following stereotactic ablative radiotherapy (SABR) for lung cancer and can be difficult to differentiate from tumor recurrence on follow-up imaging. We previously showed the ability of computed tomography (CT) texture analysis to predict recurrence. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the accuracy of recurrence prediction using manual region-of-interest segmentation to that of a semiautomatic approach. We analyzed 22 patients treated for 24 lesions (11 recurrences, 13 RILI). Consolidative and ground-glass opacity (GGO) regions were manually delineated. The longest axial diameter of the consolidative region on each post-SABR CT image was measured. This line segment is routinely obtained as part of the clinical imaging workflow and was used as input to automatically delineate the consolidative region and subsequently derive a periconsolidative region to sample GGO tissue. Texture features were calculated, and at two to five months post-SABR, the entropy texture measure within the semiautomatic segmentations showed prediction accuracies [areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC): 0.70 to 0.73] similar to those of manual GGO segmentations (AUC: 0.64). After integration into the clinical workflow, this decision support system has the potential to support earlier salvage for patients with recurrence and fewer investigations of benign RILI.']	('Mattonen', 'Sarah A')	Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)

['Genomic and radiomic imaging profiles of invasive breast carcinomas from The Cancer Genome Atlas and The Cancer Imaging Archive were integrated and a comprehensive analysis was conducted to predict clinical outcomes using the radiogenomic features. Variable selection via LASSO and logistic regression were used to select the most-predictive radiogenomic features for the clinical phenotypes, including pathological stage, lymph node metastasis, and status of estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). Cross-validation with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was employed as the prediction metric. Higher AUCs were obtained in the prediction of pathological stage, ER, and PR status than for lymph node metastasis and HER2 status. Overall, the prediction performances by genomics alone, radiomics alone, and combined radiogenomics features showed statistically significant correlations with clinical outcomes; however, improvement on the prediction performance by combining genomics and radiomics data was not found to be statistically significant, most likely due to the small sample size of 91 cancer cases with 38 radiomic features and 144 genomic features.']	('Guo', 'Wentian')	Journal of medical imaging (Bellingham, Wash.)

['We have previously studied the function of microRNAs (miRNAs) in thyroid cells using the differentiated rat thyroid PC Cl 3 cells that need thyrotropin (TSH) for their growth. The miRNA expression profile examination allowed the detection of a set of miRNAs downregulated and upregulated by TSH. Here, we first demonstrated that upregulation of miR-130b-3p occurs through a protein kinase A-cAMP-responsive element binding protein (CREB)-dependent mechanism. Then, we analyzed its expression in human thyroid follicular adenomas, where a constitutive CREB activation is frequently present. miR-130b-3p results in upregulation with a high fold-change in most thyroid follicular adenomas. Then, we identified CCDC6, coding for a protein that interacts with CREB1 leading to the transcriptional repression of CREB1 target genes, as a target of this miRNA. The targeting of CCDC6 by miR-130b-3p likely accounts for the mechanism by which its upregulation contributes to the development of thyroid adenomas increasing CREB1 activity.']	('Leone', 'Vincenza')	European thyroid journal	Eur Thyroid J	['eng']

26835414	2015	01	Applications of High-Throughput Clonogenic Survival Assays in High-LET Particle Microbeams.	"[""Charged particle therapy is increasingly becoming a valuable tool in cancer treatment, mainly due to the favorable interaction of particle radiation with matter. Its application is still limited due, in part, to lack of data regarding the radiosensitivity of certain cell lines to this radiation type, especially to high-linear energy transfer (LET) particles. From the earliest days of radiation biology, the clonogenic survival assay has been used to provide radiation response data. This method produces reliable data but it is not optimized for high-throughput microbeam studies with high-LET radiation where high levels of cell killing lead to a very low probability of maintaining cells' clonogenic potential. A new method, therefore, is proposed in this paper, which could potentially allow these experiments to be conducted in a high-throughput fashion. Cells are seeded in special polypropylene dishes and bright-field illumination provides cell visualization. Digital images are obtained and cell detection is applied based on corner detection, generating individual cell targets as x-y points. These points in the dish are then irradiated individually by a micron field size high-LET microbeam. Post-irradiation, time-lapse imaging follows cells' response. All irradiated cells are tracked by linking trajectories in all time-frames, based on finding their nearest position. Cell divisions are detected based on cell appearance and individual cell temporary corner density. The number of divisions anticipated is low due to the high probability of cell killing from high-LET irradiation. Survival curves are produced based on cell's capacity to divide at least four to five times. The process is repeated for a range of doses of radiation. Validation shows the efficiency of the proposed cell detection and tracking method in finding cell divisions.""]"	('Georgantzoglou', 'Antonios')	Frontiers in oncology	Front Oncol	['eng']

To examine whether enhancing endotoxin-neutralizing and anti-infective activity by exogenous administration of a recombinant N-terminal fragment of BPI (rBPI 21, generic name opebacan) might ameliorate regimen-related toxicities including infection, we recruited patients scheduled to undergo myeloablative HCT to participate in a proof-of-concept prospective phase I/II trial. After the HCT preparative regimen was completed, opebacan was initiated 18-36 hours prior to administration of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cells (defined as Day 0) and continued for 72 hours. The trial was to have included escalation of rBPI 21 dose and duration but was stopped prematurely due to lack of further drug availability.\xa0 Therefore, to better understand the clinical course of opebacan-treated patients (n=6), we compared their outcomes with a comparable cohort meeting the same eligibility criteria and enrolled in a non-interventional myeloablative HCT observational study (n = 35).\xa0 Opebacan-treated participants had earlier platelet engraftment (p=0.005), mirroring beneficial effects of rBPI 21 previously observed in irradiated mice, fewer documented infections (p=0.03) and appeared less likely to experience significant regimen-related toxicities (p=0.05). This small pilot experience supports the potential utility of rBPI 21 in ameliorating HCT-related morbidity and merits further exploration.']	('Guinan', 'Eva')	F1000Research	F1000Res	['eng']

['Complete response (CR) rates reported for cytotoxic chemotherapy for late-stage cancer patients are generally low, with few exceptions, regardless of the solid cancer type or drug regimen. We investigated CR rates reported in the literature for clinical trials using chemotherapy alone, across a wide range of tumour types and chemotherapeutic regimens, to determine an overall CR rate for late-stage cancers. A total of 141 reports were located using the PubMed database. A meta-analysis was performed of reported CR from 68 chemotherapy trials (total 2732 patients) using standard agents across late-stage solid cancers-a binomial model with random effects was adopted. Mean CR rates were compared for different cancer types, and for chemotherapeutic agents with different mechanisms of action, using a logistic regression. Our results showed that the CR rates for chemotherapy treatment of late-stage cancer were generally low at 7.4%, regardless of the cancer type or drug regimen used. We found no evidence that CR rates differed between different chemotherapy drug types, but amongst different cancer types small CR differences were evident, although none exceeded a mean CR rate of 11%. This remarkable concordance of CR rates regardless of cancer or therapy type remains currently unexplained, and motivates further investigation.']	('Ashdown', 'Martin L')	F1000Research	F1000Res	['eng']

Although naked DNA uptake into skeletal muscle is possible, it is largely inefficient in the absence of additional chemical or physical delivery methods. We describe a system for delivery of non-viral or plasmid DNA to skeletal muscle using ultrasound-assisted sonoporation of a nanoplex combining plasmid DNA and a branched polymer based on poly(cyclooctene-graft-oligopeptide). The materials and methods described herein promise to advance the field of sonodelivery and of gene delivery to muscle for therapeutic applications since a simple system is presented that enables long-term gene expression in vivo with the promise of a minimal inflammatory gene expression profile.']	('Neto', 'Manoel Figueiredo')	Materials (Basel, Switzerland)	Materials (Basel)	['eng']

['The roles of Silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog 1 (SIRT1) and High mobility group A1 (HMGA1) in human diseases have been extensively studied separately; however, to the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first to report on their interrelationship in lung cancer. The association of SIRT1 and HMGA1 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was investigated by evaluating their expression and prognostic significance in 260 patients with NSCLC using immunohistochemistry. SIRT1 and HMGA1 expression were found to be significantly correlated with each other (P<0.001), and both were significantly associated with clinicopathological parameters, including histological type and degree of differentiation. In squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), SIRT1+ specimens were significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) time (P=0.019). However, in patients with adenocarcinoma (AD), no association was identified between SIRT1 and OS. In addition, HMGA1+ specimens were significantly associated with poor differentiation (P=0.028), and were more frequent in SCC than AD (P=0.015). However, HMGA1 was not associated with OS on univariate Cox regression analysis or Kaplan-Meier analysis (both P>0.05). SIRT1/HMGA1 coexpression was significantly associated with male gender (P=0.016), and moderately and poorly differentiated histological grade (P=0.025). The findings indicate that SIRT1 and HMGA1 may have significant effects during tumor progression in NSCLC, particularly in patients with SCC, and are potentially useful as prognostic indicators for patients with NSCLC.']	('Lin', 'Shuang-Yan')	Oncology letters	Oncol Lett	['eng']

26834850	2016	11	Pediatric obesity: Causes, symptoms, prevention and treatment.	['Pediatric or childhood obesity is the most prevalent nutritional disorder among children and adolescents worldwide. Approximately 43 million individuals are obese, 21-24% children and adolescents are overweight, and 16-18% of individuals have abdominal obesity. The prevalence of obesity is highest among specific ethnic groups. Obesity increases the risk of heart diseases in children and adults. Childhood obesity predisposes the individual to insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, liver and kidney diseases and causes reproductive dysfunction in adults. Obesity in children is a major health concern of the developed world. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey has reported that the prevalence of obesity is on the increase in all the pediatric age groups, in males and females, and in various ethnic and racial groups. Factors, such as eating habits, genetics, environment, metabolism, and lifestyle play an important role in the development of obesity. Over 90% of obesity cases are idiopathic and less than 10% are associated with genetic and hormonal causes. Obesity occurs when the body consumes more calories than it burns, through overeating and underexercising. The symptoms of obesity include breathing disorders, sleep apnea, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, certain types of cancer such as prostate, bowel, breast and uterine, coronary heart disease, diabetes (type 2 in children), depression, liver and gallbladder problems, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, stroke, and joint diseases such as osteoarthritis, pain in knees and lower back. Environmental, behavioral such as consumption of convenience foods, genetic, and family factors contribute to pediatric obesity. Obesity can be countered through lower calorie consumption, weight loss and diet programs, as well as increased physical activity. A number of endogenous molecules including leptin, hypothalamic melanocortin 4 receptor, and mitochondrial uncoupling proteins, are known to affect body weight. These molecules serve as potential targets for the pharmacological manipulation of obesity. Sibutramine and orlistat are primariliy used for the treatment of adult obesity, which produces modest weight loss, of 3-8% compared to placebo. For children and obese adolescents, metformin is used in the case of insulin resistance and hyperinsulinemia. Octreotide is used for hypothalamic obesity. Bariatric surgery is performed for the treatment of severe childhood obesity. The causes, symptoms, prevention and treatment of pediatric obesity are described in the present review.']	('Xu', 'Shumei')	Experimental and therapeutic medicine	Exp Ther Med	['eng']

To characterize the pathogenicity and plasticity of cells that produce IL-22, a novel reporter mouse strain was generated. Homeostatic IL-22 reporter expression was observed in intestinal lymphoid cells identified as CD4 T cells and ILC3 cells. In a model of inflammatory bowel disease, CD4 T cells strongly expressed the IL-22 reporter in mesenteric lymph node. To examine plasticity of IL-22(+) T cells, they were purified after generation in vitro or in vivo from inflamed colon, and then cultured under Th1, Th2, or Th17 conditions. In vitro-generated IL-22(+) CD4 T cells showed relatively durable IL-22 expression under Th1 or Th2 conditions, whereas in vivo-generated cells rapidly lost IL-22 expression under these conditions. In vitro-generated cells could not be diverted to express Th1 or Th2 cytokines despite the expression of ""master regulators."" In vivo-generated cells could be diverted, at very low frequency, to express Th1 or Th2 cytokines. Both in vitro- and in vivo-generated cells could be induced in vitro to express high levels of IL-17A and IL-17F, assigning them to a ""Th17 biased"" class. However, IL-27 potently downregulated IL-22 expression. To examine IL-22(+) T cell pathogenicity, in vitro-generated cells were transferred into Rag1(-/-) mice, retaining the modest reporter expression and inducing moderate colitis. In contrast, IL-22 expressers from colitic mice, transferred into secondary hosts, lost reporter expression, acquired high T-bet and modest IFN? and IL-17 expression, and induced severe colitis.

26834703	2015	01	microRNAs as Potential Biomarkers in Adrenocortical Cancer: Progress and Challenges.	['Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignancy with poor prognosis and limited therapeutic options. Over the last decade, pan-genomic analyses of genetic and epigenetic alterations and genome-wide expression profile studies allowed major advances in the understanding of the molecular genetics of ACC. Besides the well-known dysfunctional molecular pathways in adrenocortical tumors, such as the IGF2 pathway, the Wnt pathway, and TP53, high-throughput technologies enabled a more comprehensive genomic characterization of adrenocortical cancer. Integration of expression profile data with exome sequencing, SNP array analysis, methylation, and microRNA (miRNA) profiling led to the identification of subgroups of malignant tumors with distinct molecular alterations and clinical outcomes. miRNAs post-transcriptionally silence their target gene expression either by degrading mRNA or by inhibiting translation. Although our knowledge of the contribution of deregulated miRNAs to the pathogenesis of ACC is still in its infancy, recent studies support their relevance in gene expression alterations in these tumors. Some miRNAs have been shown to carry potential diagnostic and prognostic values, while others may be good candidates for therapeutic interventions. With the emergence of disease-specific blood-borne miRNAs signatures, analyses of small cohorts of patients with ACC suggest that circulating miRNAs represent promising non-invasive biomarkers of malignancy or recurrence. However, some technical challenges still remain, and most of the miRNAs reported in the literature have not yet been validated in sufficiently powered and longitudinal studies. In this review, we discuss the current knowledge regarding the deregulation of tumor-associated and circulating miRNAs in ACC patients, while emphasizing their potential significance in pathogenic pathways in light of recent insights into the role of miRNAs in shaping the tumor microenvironment.']	('Cherradi', 'Nadia')	Frontiers in endocrinology	Front Endocrinol (Lausanne)	['eng']

['Although survival rates of breast, colon, and prostate cancers are improving, deaths from these tumors frequently occur due to metastasis. Voltage-gated Na(+) channels (VGSCs) are membrane proteins, which regulate membrane current and cellular migration during nervous system organogenesis. VGSCs are also expressed in fibroblasts, immune cells, glia, and metastatic cancer cells. VGSCs regulate migration and invasion of breast, bowel, and prostate cancer cells, suggesting that they may be novel anti-metastatic targets. We conducted a systematic review of clinical and preclinical studies testing the effects of VGSC-inhibiting drugs in cancer. Two-hundred and four publications were identified, of which two human, two mouse, and 20 in vitro publications were included. In the clinical studies, the effect of these drugs on survival and metastatic relapse is not clear. The 22 preclinical studies collectively suggest that several VGSC-inhibiting drugs inhibit cancer proliferation, migration, and invasion. None of the human and only six of the preclinical studies directly investigated the effect of the drugs on VGSC activity. Studies were difficult to compare due to lack of standardized methodology and outcome measures. We conclude that the benefits of VGSC inhibitors require further investigation. Standardization of future studies and outcome measures should enable meaningful study comparisons.']	('Martin', 'Fabiola')	Frontiers in pharmacology	Front Pharmacol	['eng']
26834560	2015	01	Exosomes as Novel Regulators of Adult Neurogenic Niches.	"['Adult neurogenesis has been convincingly demonstrated in two regions of the mammalian brain: the sub-granular zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus (DG) in the hippocampus, and the sub-ventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral ventricles (LV). SGZ newborn neurons are destined to the granular cell layer (GCL) of the DG, while new neurons from the SVZ neurons migrate rostrally into the olfactory bulb (OB). The process of adult neurogenesis persists throughout life and is supported by a pool of neural stem cells (NSCs), which reside in a unique and specialized microenvironment known as ""neurogenic niche"". Neurogenic niches are structured by a complex organization of different cell types, including the NSC-neuron lineage, glial cells and vascular cells. Thus, cell-to-cell communication plays a key role in the dynamic modulation of homeostasis and plasticity of the adult neurogenic process. Specific cell-cell contacts and extracellular signals originated locally provide the necessary support and regulate the balance between self-renewal and differentiation of NSCs. Furthermore, extracellular signals originated at distant locations, including other brain regions or systemic organs, may reach the niche through the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) or the vasculature and influence its nature. The role of several secreted molecules, such as cytokines, growth factors, neurotransmitters, and hormones, in the biology of adult NSCs, has been systematically addressed. Interestingly, in addition to these well-recognized signals, a novel type of intercellular messengers has been identified recently: the extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs, and particularly exosomes, are implicated in the transfer of mRNAs, microRNAs (miRNAs), proteins and lipids between cells and thus are able to modify the function of recipient cells. Exosomes appear to play a significant role in different stem cell niches such as the mesenchymal stem cell niche, cancer stem cell niche and pre-metastatic niche; however, their roles in adult neurogenic niches remain virtually unexplored. This review focuses on the current knowledge regarding the functional relationship between cellular and extracellular components of the adult SVZ and SGZ neurogenic niches, and the growing evidence that supports the potential role of exosomes in the physiology and pathology of adult neurogenesis.']"	('Bátiz', 'Luis Federico')	Frontiers in cellular neuroscience	Front Cell Neurosci	['eng']

26834506	2016	02	Semiparametric Estimation in the Secondary Analysis of Case-Control Studies.	['We study the regression relationship among covariates in case-control data, an area known as the secondary analysis of case-control studies. The context is such that only the form of the regression mean is specified, so that we allow an arbitrary regression error distribution, which can depend on the covariates and thus can be heteroscedastic. Under mild regularity conditions we establish the theoretical identifiability of such models. Previous work in this context has either (a) specified a fully parametric distribution for the regression errors, (b) specified a homoscedastic distribution for the regression errors, (c) has specified the rate of disease in the population (we refer this as true population), or (d) has made a rare disease approximation. We construct a class of semiparametric estimation procedures that rely on none of these. The estimators differ from the usual semiparametric ones in that they draw conclusions about the true population, while technically operating in a hypothetic superpopulation. We also construct estimators with a unique feature, in that they are robust against the misspecification of the regression error distribution in terms of variance structure, while all other nonparametric effects are estimated despite of the biased samples. We establish the asymptotic properties of the estimators and illustrate their finite sample performance through simulation studies, as well as through an empirical example on the relation between red meat consumption and heterocyclic amines. Our analysis verified the positive relationship between red meat consumption and two forms of HCA, indicating that increased red meat consumption leads to increased levels of MeIQA and PhiP, both being risk factors for colorectal cancer.

26832848	2015	08	Favorable clinical outcome and unique characteristics in association with Twist1 overexpression in de novo acute myeloid leukemia.	['Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a critical process for inducing stem-like properties of epithelial cancer cells. However, the role of EMT inducers in hematological malignancies is unknown. Twist1, an EMT inducer necessary for cell migration, has recently been found to have transcriptionally regulatory activity on the expression of Bmi1, and these two are capable of promoting tumorigenesis in a synergized manner. Knowing that Bmi1 expression is essential for maintenance of leukemic stem cells, we speculate that Twist1 might govern the pathogenesis of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) development as well. We found that upregulated Twist1 increased Bmi1 expression in AML and endued leukemic cells a higher proliferative potential and increased resistance to apoptosis. In primary AML samples, there was strong positive correlation between the expression levels of Twist1 and Bmi1. AML patients whose leukemic blasts harbored overexpressed Twist1 had a more aggressive clinical phenotype, but they were more likely to have a better clinical outcome after standard therapy. In vitro studies confirmed that Twist1-overexpressing leukemic cells were more susceptible to cytarabine, but not daunorubicin, cytotoxicity. Our findings suggest that, in a subset of AML patients, Twist1 has a prominent role in the pathogenesis of the disease that leads to unique clinical phenotypes.']	('Chen', 'C-C')	Blood cancer journal	Blood Cancer J	['eng']
26832847	2015	08	Rationale for revision and proposed changes of the WHO diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia and primary myelofibrosis.	['The 2001/2008 World Health Organization (WHO)-based diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) were recently revised to accomodate new information on disease-specific mutations and underscore distinguishing morphologic features. In this context, it seems to be reasonable to compare first major diagnostic criteria of the former WHO classifications for myeloproliferative neoplasm (MPN) and then to focus on details that have been discussed and will be proposed for the upcoming revision of diagnostic guidelines. In PV, a characteristic bone marrow (BM) morphology was added as one of three major diagnostic criteria, which allowed lowering of the hemoglobin/hematocrit threshold for diagnosis, which is another major criterion, to 16.5\u2009g/dl/49% in men and 16\u2009g/dl/48% in women. The presence of a JAK2 mutation remains the third major diagnostic criterion in PV. Subnormal serum erythropoietin level is now the only minor criterion in PV and is used to capture JAK2-unmutated cases. In ET and PMF, mutations that are considered to confirm clonality and specific diagnosis now include CALR, in addition to JAK2 and MPL. Also in the 2015 discussed revision, overtly fibrotic PMF is clearly distinguished from early/prefibrotic PMF and each PMF variant now includes a separate list of diagnostic criteria. The main rationale for these changes was to enhance the distinction between so-called masked PV and JAK2-mutated ET and between ET and prefibrotic early PMF. The proposed changes also underscore the complementary role, as well as limitations of mutation analysis in morphologic diagnosis. On the other hand, discovery of new biological markers may probably be expected in the future to enhance discrimination of the different MPN subtypes in accordance with the histological BM patterns and corresponding clinical features.']	('Barbui', 'T')	Blood cancer journal	Blood Cancer J	['eng']

FLT3-ITD was detected in 73 of 363 adult AML patients (20.1%) and high mutant allelic burden (?50%, n=13) and long ITD length (?70 base pairs, n=15) were significantly associated with inferior overall survival (OS; P=0.002 and 0.005, respectively) and event-free survival (EFS; P=0.004 and 0.007, respectively).

In cytogenetically normal AML, even FLT3-ITD low allele burden and short length was associated with poorer OS (P=0.037) and EFS (P=0.044) than wild type, whose influence was overcome when hematopoietic stem cell transplantation was performed. In minimal residual disease monitoring, FLT3-ITD negativity after consolidation therapy was a valuable predictor of better OS (P<0.001) and EFS (P<0.001).

26831269	2016	11	Development of intelligent systems based on Bayesian regularization network and neuro-fuzzy models for mass detection in mammograms: A comparative analysis.	['Female breast cancer is the second most common cancer in the world. Several efforts in artificial intelligence have been made to help improving the diagnostic accuracy at earlier stages. However, the identification of breast abnormalities, like masses, on mammographic images is not a trivial task, especially for dense breasts. In this paper we describe our novel mass detection process that includes three successive steps of enhancement, characterization and classification. The proposed enhancement system is based mainly on the analysis of the breast texture. First of all, a filtering step with morphological operators and soft thresholding is achieved. Then, we remove from the filtered breast region, all the details that may interfere with the eventual masses, including pectoral muscle and galactophorous tree. The pixels belonging to this tree will be interpolated and replaced by the average of the neighborhood. In the characterization process, measurement of the Gaussian density in the wavelet domain allows the segmentation of the masses. Finally, a comparative classification mechanism based on the Bayesian regularization back-propagation networks and ANFIS techniques is proposed. The tests were conducted on the MIAS database. The results showed the robustness of the proposed enhancement method.']	('Mahersia', 'Hela')	Computer methods and programs in biomedicine	Comput Methods Programs Biomed	['eng']

['Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumours in humans and are associated with a poor prognosis. An accurate animal model of human glioma tumorigenesis is needed to test new treatment strategies. Dogs represent a promising model because they develop spontaneous diffusely-infiltrating gliomas. This study investigated whether spontaneous canine gliomas contain cancer stem cells previously identified in all grades of human gliomas. Twenty spontaneous cases of canine gliomas were graded according to the human WHO classification. The expression of different markers of lineage differentiation was evaluated with immunohistochemistry as follows: nestin and CD133 for neural stem cells, doublecortin for neuronal progenitor cells, Olig2 for glial progenitor cells, glial fibrillary acidic protein, vimentin and S-100 for mature glial cells, and NeuN and ?III-tubulin for mature neurons. Gliomas were characterised as follows: five grade II (oligodendrogliomas); nine grade III (seven anaplastic oligodendrogliomas, one anaplastic astrocytoma, one anaplastic oligoastrocytoma); six grade IV (glioblastomas). Immunohistochemical evaluation revealed that (1) nestin and CD133 were expressed in all grades of gliomas with a higher proportion of positive cells in high-grade gliomas; (2) the expression of S-100 protein and Olig2 did not differ substantially between astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumours, and (3) all gliomas were negative for mature neuron markers. The results demonstrated the presence of undifferentiated neural progenitors in all grades of spontaneous canine gliomas, confirming the relevance of this animal model for further studies on cancer stem cells.']	('Fernández', 'Francisco')	Veterinary journal (London, England : 1997)	Vet.

"[""High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) has the highest mortality rate among all gynecological cancers.

In the current review, we discuss experimental HGSOC models in which resistance to platinum therapy and the use of novel therapeutics can be carefully studied. Panels of better-defined primary cell lines need to be established to capture the full spectrum of HGSOC subtypes. Further refinement of cell lines is obtained with a 3-dimensional culture model mimicking the tumor microenvironment. Alternatively, ex vivo ovarian tumor tissue slices are used. For in vivo studies, larger panels of ovarian cancer patient-derived xenografts (PDXs) are being established, encompassing all expression subtypes. Ovarian cancer PDXs grossly retain tumor heterogeneity and clinical response to platinum therapy is preserved. PDXs are currently used in drug screens and as avatars for patient response. The role of the immune system in tumor responses can be assessed using humanized PDXs and immunocompetent genetically engineered mouse models. Dynamic tracking of genetic alterations in PDXs as well as patients during treatment and after relapse is feasible by sequencing circulating cell-free tumor DNA and analyzing circulating tumor cells. We discuss how various models and methods can be combined to delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying platinum resistance and to select HGSOC patients other than BRCA1/2-mutation carriers that could potentially benefit from the synthetic lethality of PARP inhibitors. This integrated approach is a first step to improve therapy outcomes in specific subgroups of HGSOC patients.""]"	('Alkema', 'Nicolette G')	Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy	Drug Resist.

['Cisplatin-based chemotherapeutic regimens are the most frequently used (neo)adjuvant treatments for the majority of solid tumors. While platinum-based chemotherapeutic regimens have proven effective against highly proliferative malignant tumors, significant relapse and progression rates as well as decreased overall survival are still observed. Currently, it is known that sub-populations of chemoresistant cells share biological properties with cancer stem cells (CSC), which are believed to be responsible for tumor relapse, invasion and ultimately disease dissemination through acquisition of mesenchymal cell traits. In spite of concentrated efforts devoted to decipher the mechanisms underlying CSC chemoresistance and to design targeted therapeutics to these cells, proteomics has failed to unveil molecular signatures capable of distinguishing between malignant and non-malignant stem cells. This has hampered substantial developments in this complex field. Envisaging a novel rationale for an effective therapy, the current review summarizes the main cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying cisplatin resistance and the impact of chemotherapy challenge in CSC selection and clinical outcome. It further emphasizes the growing amount of data supporting a role for protein glycosylation in drug resistance. The dynamic and context-dependent nature of protein glycosylation is also comprehensively discussed, hence highlighting its potentially important role as a biomarker of CSC. As the paradigm of cancer therapeutics shifts towards precision medicine and patient-tailored therapeutics, we bring into focus the need to introduce glycomics and glycoproteomics in holistic pan-omics models, in order to integrate diverse, multimodal and clinically relevant information towards more effective cancer therapeutics.']	('Ferreira', 'José Alexandre')	Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy	Drug Resist.

26830313	2016	11	Lysosomes as mediators of drug resistance in cancer.	['Drug resistance remains a leading cause of chemotherapeutic treatment failure and cancer-related mortality. While some mechanisms of anticancer drug resistance have been well characterized, multiple mechanisms remain elusive. In this respect, passive ion trapping-based lysosomal sequestration of multiple hydrophobic weak-base chemotherapeutic agents was found to reduce the accessibility of these drugs to their target sites, resulting in a markedly reduced cytotoxic effect and drug resistance. Recently we have demonstrated that lysosomal sequestration of hydrophobic weak base drugs triggers TFEB-mediated lysosomal biogenesis resulting in an enlarged lysosomal compartment, capable of enhanced drug sequestration. This study further showed that cancer cells with an increased number of drug-accumulating lysosomes are more resistant to lysosome-sequestered drugs, suggesting a model of drug-induced lysosome-mediated chemoresistance. In addition to passive drug sequestration of hydrophobic weak base chemotherapeutics, other mechanisms of lysosome-mediated drug resistance have also been reported; these include active lysosomal drug sequestration mediated by ATP-driven transporters from the ABC superfamily, and a role for lysosomal copper transporters in cancer resistance to platinum-based chemotherapeutics. Furthermore, lysosomal exocytosis was suggested as a mechanism to facilitate the clearance of chemotherapeutics which highly accumulated in lysosomes, thus providing an additional line of resistance, supplementing the organelle entrapment of chemotherapeutics away from their target sites. Along with these mechanisms of lysosome-mediated drug resistance, several approaches were recently developed for the overcoming of drug resistance or exploiting lysosomal drug sequestration, including lysosomal photodestruction and drug-induced lysosomal membrane permeabilization. In this review we explore the current literature addressing the role of lysosomes in mediating cancer drug resistance as well as novel modalities to overcome this chemoresistance.']	('Zhitomirsky', 'Benny')	Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy	Drug Resist.

['Although survival rates among patients with breast cancer have improved in recent years, those diagnosed with advanced disease with distant metastasis face a 5-year survival rate of less than 25%, making the management of these patients an area still in significant need of continued research. Selecting the optimal treatment order from among the variety of currently available therapy options presents a relevant challenge for medical oncologists. With the understanding that the majority of patients with breast cancer and those who succumb to this disease have HR-positive disease, this review will focus on treatment options and treatment order in patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer. While endocrine therapy is considered the preferred treatment for first-line therapy in HR-positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, selection of the specific agent depends on the menopausal status of the patient. Palbociclib, a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitor, is also recommended as first-line treatment in patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative disease. In patients with endocrine therapy-resistant disease, specific strategies include sequencing of other antiestrogen receptor agents, or agents that target other molecular pathways. Future treatment strategies for patients with primary or secondary resistance to endocrine therapy for advanced disease are discussed. These strategies include first-line therapy with high-dose fulvestrant or everolimus (in combination with exemestane or letrozole or with other endocrine therapies), use of the PI3K inhibitors (e.g., buparlisib, alpelisib, pictilisib, taselisib), entinostat, CDK 4/6 inhibitors (e.g., palbociclib, ribociclib, abemaciclib), and novel selective estrogen receptor degradation agents that may enhance the targeting of acquired mutations in the ESR1 gene.']	('Perez', 'Edith A')	Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy	Drug Resist.

26830311	2016	11	Mitotic catastrophe and cancer drug resistance: A link that must to be broken.	['An increased tendency of genomic alterations during the life cycle of cells leads to genomic instability, which is a major driving force for tumorigenesis. A considerable fraction of tumor cells are tetraploid or aneuploid, which renders them intrinsically susceptible to mitotic aberrations, and hence, are particularly sensitive to the induction of mitotic catastrophe. Resistance to cell death is also closely linked to genomic instability, as it enables malignant cells to expand even in a stressful environment. Currently it is known that cells can die via multiple mechanisms. Mitotic catastrophe represents a step preceding apoptosis or necrosis, depending on the expression and/or proper function of several proteins. Mitotic catastrophe was proposed to be an onco-suppressive mechanism and the evasion of mitotic catastrophe constitutes one of the gateways to cancer development. Thus, stimulation of mitotic catastrophe appears to be a promising strategy in cancer treatment. Indeed, several chemotherapeutic drugs are currently used at concentrations that induce apoptosis irrespective of the cell cycle phase, yet are very efficient at triggering mitotic catastrophe at lower doses, significantly limiting side effects. In the present review we summarize current data concerning the role of mitotic catastrophe in cancer drug resistance and discuss novel strategies to break this link.']	('Denisenko', 'Tatiana V')	Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy	Drug Resist.

['Since the discovery of 1?,25(OH)2D3 in the early 1970s, it has been widely accepted that this metabolite is responsible for the biological actions of vitamin D. Likewise, we have assumed that 25(OH)-19-nor-D3-dependent growth inhibition of human prostate PZ-HPV-7 cells was the result of its subsequent conversion to 1?,25(OH)2-19-nor-D3, catalyzed by CYP27B1 within the prostate cells. However, further in vitro studies in a reconstituted system using recombinant CYP27B1 revealed that 25(OH)-19-nor-D3 was hardly converted to 1?,25(OH)2-19-nor-D3 by the enzyme. The kinetic analysis of 1?-hydroxylation of 25(OH)D3 and 25(OH)-19-nor-D3 demonstrated that the k(cat)/K(m) for 25(OH)-19-nor-D3 is less than 0.1% of that for 25(OH)D3. When 25(OH)-19-nor-D3 was added to cultured PZ-HPV-7 cells, eight metabolites were detected, while no 1?,25(OH)2-19-nor-D3 was found. In addition, the time course of VDR translocation into the nucleus induced by 100 nM 25(OH)-19-nor-D3, and the subsequent transactivation of CYP24A1 gene were almost identical to those induced by 1 nM 1?,25(OH)2-19-nor-D3. These results strongly suggest that 25(OH)-19-nor-D3 binds directly to VDR as a ligand to transport VDR into the nucleus to induce CYP24A1 gene transactivation. Furthermore, knockdown of CYP27B1 gene did not affect the antiproliferative activity of 25(OH)-19-nor-D3, whereas VDR knockdown attenuated the effect, suggesting that the antiproliferative activity of 25(OH)-19-nor-D3 is VDR dependent but CYP27B1 independent. Finally, our recent studies using the same cell line demonstrate that 25(OH)D3 can act as a VDR agonist to induce gene transactivation.

26827958	2016	12	Vitamin D in Prostate Cancer.	['Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) is a progressive, noncurable disease induced by androgen receptor (AR) upon its activation by tumor tissue androgen, which is generated from adrenal steroid dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) through intracrine androgen biosynthesis. Inhibition of mCRPC and early-stage, androgen-dependent prostate cancer by calcitriol, the bioactive vitamin D3 metabolite, is amply documented in cell culture and animal studies. However, clinical trials of calcitriol or synthetic analogs are inconclusive, although encouraging results have recently emerged from pilot studies showing efficacy of a safe-dose vitamin D3 supplementation in reducing tumor tissue inflammation and progression of low-grade prostate cancer. Vitamin D-mediated inhibition of normal and malignant prostate cells is caused by diverse mechanisms including G1/S cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, prodifferentiation gene expression changes, and suppressed angiogenesis and cell migration. Biological effects of vitamin D are mediated by altered expression of a gene network regulated by the vitamin D receptor (VDR), which is a multidomain, ligand-inducible transcription factor similar to AR and other nuclear receptors. AR-VDR cross talk modulates androgen metabolism in prostate cancer cells. Androgen inhibits vitamin D-mediated induction of CYP24A1, the calcitriol-degrading enzyme, while vitamin D promotes androgen inactivation by inducing phase I monooxygenases (e.g., CYP3A4) and phase II transferases (e.g., SULT2B1b, a DHEA-sulfotransferase). CYP3A4 and SULT2B1b levels are markedly reduced and CYP24A1 is overexpressed in advanced prostate cancer. In future trials, combining low-calcemic, potent next-generation calcitriol analogs with CYP24A1 inhibition or androgen supplementation, or cancer stem cell suppression by a phytonutrient such as sulfarophane, may prove fruitful in prostate cancer prevention and treatment.']	('Ahn', 'Jungmi')	Vitamins and hormones	Vitam.

More recently, calcitriol and VDR have been shown to control the expression of genes associated with cellular proliferation and differentiation in a wide variety of cells, suggesting more extensive biological activities for the vitamin D system. Recently, calcitriol and several structurally related members of the vitamin D class of seco-steroids have demonstrated the ability to regulate the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway. Hh signaling plays an essential role with respect to tissue differentiation during embryogenesis and maintains stem cell populations in certain adult tissues. Potential mechanisms of cross talk between the two signaling pathways highlight our evolving understanding of the complexities of calcitriol/VDR signaling and suggest a cooperative role during multiple stages of human development and disease.']	('Hadden', 'M Kyle')	Vitamins and hormones	Vitam.

26827737	2016	10	Acute Perforated Diverticulitis: Assessment With Multidetector Computed Tomography.	['Colonic diverticulitis is a common condition in the western population. Complicated diverticulitis is defined as the presence of extraluminal air or abscess, peritonitis, colon occlusion, or fistulas. Multidetector row computed tomography (MDCT) is the modality of choice for the diagnosis and the staging of diverticulitis and its complications, which enables performing an accurate differential diagnosis and addressing the patients to a correct management. MDCT is accurate in diagnosing the site of perforation in approximately 85% of cases, by the detection of direct signs (focal bowel wall discontinuity, extraluminal gas, and extraluminal enteric contrast) and indirect signs, which are represented by segmental bowel wall thickening, abnormal bowel wall enhancement, perivisceral fat stranding of fluid, and abscess. MDCT is accurate in the differentiation from complicated colon diverticulitis and colon cancer, often with a similar imaging. The computed tomography-guided classification is recommended to discriminate patients with mild diverticulitis, generally treated with antibiotics, from those with severe diverticulitis with a large abscess, which may be drained with a percutaneous approach.']	('Sessa', 'Barbara')	Seminars in ultrasound, CT, and MR	Semin.

26827696	2016	12	Therapy of leptomeningeal metastasis in solid tumors.	['Leptomeningeal metastasis (LM), i.e. the seeding of tumor cells to the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and the leptomeninges, is a devastating and mostly late-stage complication of various solid tumors. Clinical signs and symptoms may include cranial nerve palsies, radicular symptoms, signs of increased intracranial pressure such as headache, nausea and vomiting, and cognitive dysfunction. In cases of suspected LM, the highest diagnostic sensitivity is provided by the combination of CSF cytology and contrast-enhanced MRI (cranial as well as complete spine). The therapeutic spectrum includes radiotherapy of the clinically involved region as well as systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy. The choice of treatment modalities depends on the type of LM (non-adherent tumor cells in the CSF vs. nodular contrast-enhancing tumor growth), additional systemic involvement (uncontrolled vs. controlled systemic disease) and additional involvement of the CNS parenchyma (LM as the only CNS involvement vs. LM+parenchymal CNS metastases). Larger contrast-enhancing nodular LM or symptomatic lesions of the spine may be treated with radiotherapy. In case of uncontrolled systemic disease, the treatment regimen should include systemic chemotherapy. The choice of systemic treatment should take into account the histology of the primary tumor. Intrathecal chemotherapy is most important in cases of LM of the non-adherent type. There are three substances for routine use for intrathecal chemotherapy: methotrexate, cytarabine, and thiotepa. Liposomal cytarabine shows advantages in terms of longer injection intervals, a sufficient distribution in the entire subarachnoid space after lumbar administration and improved quality-of-life. The role of new agents (e.g. rituximab and trastuzumab) for intrathecal therapy is still unclear.']	('Mack', 'F')	Cancer treatment reviews	Cancer Treat. Rev.	['eng']

26827693	2016	04	The safety profile of vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) in hematologic malignancies: A review of clinical studies.	['Histone acetyltransferases and histone deacetylases (HDACs) are multifunctional enzymes that posttranslationally modify both histone and nonhistone acetylation sites, affecting a broad range of cellular processes (e.g., cell cycle, apoptosis, and protein folding) often dysregulated in cancer. HDAC inhibitors are small molecules that directly interact with HDAC catalytic sites preventing the removal of acetyl groups, thereby counteracting the effects of HDACs. Since the first HDAC inhibitor, valproic acid, was investigated as a potential antitumor agent, there have been a number of other HDAC inhibitors developed to improve efficacy and safety. Despite significant progress in the management of patients with hematologic malignancies, overall survival is still poor. The discovery that HDACs may play a role in hematologic malignancies and preclinical studies showing promising activity with HDAC inhibitors in various tumor types, led to clinical evaluation of HDAC inhibitors as potential treatment options for patients with advanced hematologic malignancies. The Food and Drug Administration has approved two HDAC inhibitors, vorinostat (2006) and romidepsin (2009), for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. This review highlights the safety of HDAC inhibitors currently approved or being investigated for the treatment of hematologic malignancies, with a specific focus on the safety experience with vorinostat in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.']	('Duvic', 'Madeleine')	Cancer treatment reviews	Cancer Treat.

['Window of opportunity studies are trials in which patients receive one or more new compounds between their cancer diagnosis and standard treatment (mainly surgery). Patients are generally cancer treatment naïve. Tumor biopsies before and after the investigational treatment are collected for translational research. Similarly, anatomic and functional pre- and post-treatment imaging may be incorporated. Ideally, the investigational treatment is kept short to avoid delaying standard treatment. Window of opportunity trials may expedite drug development, improve our understanding of pharmacodynamic parameters, and help to identify biomarkers for better patient selection. They can, however, have major drawbacks including potential safety and logistical issues, delayed standard treatment, and a probable lack of patient benefit. By focusing on breast and head and neck cancers, in this paper we discuss the advantages, disadvantages and design of window of opportunity studies.']	('Schmitz', 'Sandra')	Cancer treatment reviews	Cancer Treat.

Despite the recent progress in targeting persistent AR activity with the next-generation hormonal therapies (abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide), resistance to these agents limits therapeutic efficacy for many patients. Several explanations for response and/or resistance to abiraterone acetate and enzalutamide are emerging, but growing interest is focusing on importance of AR splice variants (AR-Vs) and in particular of AR-V7. Increasing evidences highlight the concept that variant expression could be used as a potential predictive biomarker and a therapeutic target in advanced prostate cancer. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms of treatment resistance or sensitivity can help to achieve a more effective management of mCRPC, increasing clinical outcomes and representing a promising and engaging area of prostate cancer research.']	('Ciccarese', 'Chiara')	Cancer treatment reviews	Cancer Treat.

26827689	2016	12	Taxanes in the treatment of breast cancer: Have we better defined their role in older patients? A position paper from a SIOG Task Force.	['Along with anthracyclines, taxanes are the most active cytotoxics in breast cancer (BC). Balancing efficacy against toxicity in older patients with reduced physiological reserves and significant comorbidities is both important and difficult. This is especially so given the under-representation of elderly patients in major trials and a consequent lack of evidence for drug, dose and schedule. However, BC is frequent in elderly women, who are a growing proportion of the population. Careful consideration of their care is therefore imperative. Treatment that can cure or extend the duration and quality of life should not be restricted by age, but needs to be tailored to the circumstances of elderly patients. In adjuvant use, taxane toxicity in older women is greater than in their younger counterparts, limiting its sequential combination with anthracyclines for high-risk disease unless patients are in very good health. More frequently taxanes are used alone (weekly paclitaxel, three-weekly docetaxel) or combined with cytotoxics other than anthracyclines (e.g. docetaxel plus cyclophosphamide) to reduce cardiac risk, especially in HER-2-positive patients who may develop additional trastuzumab-related cardiac events. In elderly patients with metastases, weekly paclitaxel and three-weekly docetaxel are among the cornerstones of treatment, with generally acceptable toxicity. Three-weekly docetaxel at the approved dose of 100mg/m(2) is not appropriate for the elderly. Nab-paclitaxel has efficacy comparable with solvent-based taxanes without need for steroid premedication but has been little studied in older BC patients. A head-to-head comparison with weekly paclitaxel favoured the solvent-free formulation for pathologic response, but those studied were a general adult population. Compared with early stage disease, choice of taxane and regimen in the metastatic setting relies even more on availability and preferences with regard to schedule, toxicity profile and cost, especially for recently developed formulations.']	('Biganzoli', 'L')	Cancer treatment reviews	Cancer Treat.

26827688	2016	12	Targeting protein kinases to reverse multidrug resistance in sarcoma.	['Sarcomas are a group of cancers that arise from transformed cells of mesenchymal origin. They can be classified into over 50 subtypes, accounting for approximately 1% of adult and 15% of pediatric cancers. Wide surgical resection, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy are the most common treatments for the majority of sarcomas. Among these therapies, chemotherapy can palliate symptoms and prolong life for some sarcoma patients. However, sarcoma cells can have intrinsic or acquired resistance after treatment with chemotherapeutics drugs, leading to the development of multidrug resistance (MDR). MDR attenuates the efficacy of anticancer drugs and results in treatment failure for sarcomas. Therefore, overcoming MDR is an unmet need for sarcoma therapy. Certain protein kinases demonstrate aberrant expression and/or activity in sarcoma cells, which have been found to be involved in the regulation of sarcoma cell progression, such as cell cycle, apoptosis, and survival. Inhibiting these protein kinases may not only decrease the proliferation and growth of sarcoma cells, but also reverse their resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs to subsequently reduce the doses of anticancer drugs and decrease drug side-effects. The discovery of novel strategies targeting protein kinases opens a door to a new area of sarcoma research and provides insight into the mechanisms of MDR in chemotherapy. This review will focus on the recent studies in targeting protein kinase to reverse chemotherapeutic drug resistance in sarcoma.']	('Chen', 'Hua')	Cancer treatment reviews	Cancer Treat. Rev.	['eng']

['Although outcomes for women with breast cancers may vary by biologic subtype, patients with T1a,b N0M0 tumors have an excellent prognosis across all subgroups. HER2 overexpression occurs in 15-20% of primary breast tumors, and is associated with diminished disease-free and overall survival. The anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody trastuzumab in combination with chemotherapy is an effective treatment for all stages of HER2 positive breast cancer (bc). However, the absolute benefit decreases as the risk of recurrence lessens and no available randomized adjuvant trial has evaluated the role of trastuzumab in women with pT1a,b N0M0, HER2-positive breast tumors. These findings may explain the debate about the appropriate indication for adjuvant chemotherapy plus trastuzumab in this setting of patients. The aim of this review was to describe known and novel prognostic risk factors to be used for tailored treatment decision in pT1a,b N0M0 HER2-positive tumors. Whether patients with small HER2-positive bc may be suitable for (chemo)therapy reduction strategies, the current available data cannot exclude the need for a more aggressive treatment in a small subset of these subjects. Novel clinical prognostic factors such as interval cancer (IC) detection may help to address this clinically important controversy. A multicenter population-based cancer registry study is currently evaluating whether IC detection may identify patients with pT1a N0M0 HER2-positive tumors in whom the rate of recurrence justifies consideration for use of conventional, trastuzumab-based chemotherapy regimens.']	('Musolino', 'Antonino')	Cancer treatment reviews	Cancer Treat.

['Oncogenic mutations in phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) are the most frequently reported in association with various forms of cancer. Several studies have reported the significance of hotspot mutations in a catalytic subunit of PIK3CA in association with breast cancer. Mutations are frequently observed in the highly conserved region of the kinase domain (797-1068 amino acids) of PIK3CA are activating or gain-of-function mutations. Mutation in codon 1047 occurs in the C-terminal region of the kinase domain with histidine (H) replaced by arginine (R), lysine (L), and tyrosine (Y). Pathogenicity and protein stability predictors PhD-SNP, Align GVGD, HANSA, iStable, and MUpro classified H1047R as highly deleterious when compared to H1047L and H1047Y. To explore the inhibitory activity of Wortmannin toward PIK3CA, the three-dimensional structure of the mutant protein was determined using homology modeling followed by molecular docking and molecular dynamics analysis. Docking studies were performed for the three mutants and native with Wortmannin to measure the differences in their binding pattern. Comparative docking study revealed that H1047R-Wortmannin complex has a higher number of hydrogen bonds as well as the best binding affinity next to the native protein. Furthermore, 100 ns molecular dynamics simulation was initiated with the docked complexes to understand the various changes induced by the mutation. Though Wortmannin was found to nullify the effect of H1047R over the protein, further studies are required for designing a better compound. As SNPs are major genetic variations observed in disease condition, personalized medicine would provide enhanced drug therapy.']	('Kumar', 'D Thirumal')	Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology	Adv Protein Chem Struct Biol	['eng']
